I've never had a job, internship, externship, or UROP. I'm not in any clubs. I haven't done well, nor am I currently doing well, in many of my classes. My advisor probably thinks I'm a piece of shit. I think I'm a piece of shit. I think I\u2019m a dumb, ugly, unmotivated, boring, socially awkward dysfunctional piece of shit. That\u2019s what goes through my head, constantly.\n\nI have issues... my biggest one is that I'm AFRAID of people. Paralyzingly afraid of people. Always worried about what people think of me, always fearing I\u2019m being watched and judged in public. I have a huge social anxiety problem. And it's cause I hate myself and have no confidence. It\u2019s probably why I never reach out to people for new friends or jobs.\n\nI\u2019m tired of spending entire weekends in my room, only going out for bathroom breaks and to get dinner in a green box. I\u2019m tired of spending hours on a pset failing to make any real progress. I\u2019m tired of struggling in office hours, hearing people say they get it and it all makes sense now when I\u2019m still confused, probably on a problem before the one they just got. I\u2019m tired of not being able to get help when I feel this way because I can\u2019t talk properly to whoever comes to help me, in excruciating discomfort and fear that they and whoever else is overhearing will probably think I\u2019m a dumbass.\n\nI\u2019ll never deliberately kill myself. I\u2019m too scared of the possibility of hell, and I don\u2019t want to put my family through the grief. But I feel trapped in my inhibitions. I have to change something. But I\u2019m not going to S^3 or mental health to do it, cause that\u2019s more people, and they\u2019ll probably just kick me out.
