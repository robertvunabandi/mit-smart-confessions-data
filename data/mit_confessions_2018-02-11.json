I have a good research position which puts food on the table and money into the bank. I've done fine at school and enjoy what I'm doing now. Family is loving and supportive. My living situation is good and I've also traveled to two dozen countries and lived in four.\n\nDespite all of that, I am deeply unhappy.\n\nIt comes down to a few things:\n[1] Uncertainty about the future/career\n[2] Struggling with being an introvert in an extroverted society\n[3] Inability to find a life partner despite numerous sincere efforts\n[4] Always investing in other people's well-being and putting myself second while getting very little in return (closely related to [3] )\n\nWhile I can identify causes, I cannot get myself out. The anxiety is taking a heavy toll on my life and potential and making me into a shell of who I was 10 years ago. There's no way around it: I need therapy.\n\nAnd thus I have learned that mental health is key.
