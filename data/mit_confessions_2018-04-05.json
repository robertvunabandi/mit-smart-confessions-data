It's because I'm not happy. I don't mean I'm depressed, I just haven't found happiness, yet so I have no reason to stop and smell the roses. This does not mean attending graduation will make me happy. People aren't happy because they stop the smell the roses, they stop to smell the roses because they're happy. So until I've found something to be happy for, I have no intention of attending graduation or doing anything that yields serves no objective purpose.", "comments": 1, "reactions": {"like": 10, "love": 3, "sorry": 2, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 23991, "page_engaged_users": 2776, "page_views": 1748, "page_consumption": 11704}}, {"created_time": "2018-04-05T06:00:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1745506588851714", "message": "#13185 saw this the other day and wanted to share:\n\n\u201cSelf care isn\u2019t always pretty.

Sometimes it is convincing yourself to do all these things you should be doing when you have no will whatsoever. Sometimes it\u2019s cutting some ties no matter how precious they used to be.
