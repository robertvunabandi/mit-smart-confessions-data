I have always been a proud atheist, and a activist for atheists. I looked at the US birth rates. Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth. I'm terrified to live in a world full of religious fanatics in a couple generations.", "comments": 19, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 0, "page_engaged_users": 0, "page_views": 0, "page_consumption": 0}}, {"created_time": "2015-09-25T13:57:09+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_949903751745339", "message": "#1860 two weeks into the semester and already feeling crushed by stress and anxiety", "comments": 0, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 0, "page_engaged_users": 0, "page_views": 0, "page_consumption": 0}}, {"created_time": "2015-09-25T13:56:57+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_949903635078684", "message": "#1859 The raging debates about sexuality on MIT Confessions seems pretty silly to someone who's never had the opportunity or choice and is about to graduate a virgin and will likely remain a basement-dwelling permavirgin.

My gf gets stressed and for her giving up all control and being forced into pain is comforting and relaxing. Like all couples we have arguments and can get angry, for me the sadistic role is a good outlet to unleash my anger in a controlled way.
