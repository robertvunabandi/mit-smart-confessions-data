How do people settle on particular passions in life when you've never had a significant life event point you in some direction? I feel like I could pretty much choose anything I want to pursue and be able to succeed, but I can't decide which thing to do. I would normally try to prioritize things I am currently interested and then as I tackle the list, try to pivot as I better learn what I'm interested in, but everything on the list is so close in priority that it seems too arbitrary.
