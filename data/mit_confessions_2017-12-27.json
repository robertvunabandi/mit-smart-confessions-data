When I ask you, my best friend, out on a date, it's not another person you sorta know asking you out: you don't understand how much I have agonized on the inside, consulted with friends, driven myself to madness, and repeated all the reasons to myself why I should back down and not risk this friendship. To say I have thought long and hard about whether to ask you out is an understatement. So I'm sorry that if after a couple of dates when you say you don't want to continue I am far more emotionally devastated than you could ever understand. And you may think you're helping by giving me space and retreating out of my life, but if you're going to do that, at least say that you are instead of leaving me wondering what I did wrong and confirming the biggest fear about asking you out: that I would lose my best friend. You don't understand the pain I go through every time you say you're not free to hang out, every time you don't want to sit next to me in class, and every time it's made obvious that I care about reestablishing our best friendship way more than you do. I'm over you romantically, but I'm not over losing my best friend.
