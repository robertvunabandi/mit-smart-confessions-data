Some people will argue \"I don't even know them!\", but tell the truth. If they hadn't explicitly said they were contemplating, you wouldn't have tried to talk them out of it. Suicide is death. It's not bad or good. It's a choice that is made by people who don't have anything they think is worth living for. Why stop them?
