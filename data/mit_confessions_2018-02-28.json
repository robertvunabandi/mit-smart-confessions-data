We have unmatched endurance among mammals, and even though your typical antelope could easily out-sprint a human, our ancestors would chase it down over tens of miles until it collapsed of exhaustion.

Modern agriculture has largely eliminated persistence hunting outside of a few isolated communities, but every once in a while, that powerful, tenacious tendency rises to the surface in unexpected ways.  This one sophomore, for example, has been hitting on me with such a relentless and powerful intensity that I'm afraid my crufty legs can't outrun her much longer.", "comments": 5, "reactions": {"like": 64, "love": 2, "haha": 62}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 22018, "page_engaged_users": 3860, "page_views": 4559, "page_consumption": 15469}}]
