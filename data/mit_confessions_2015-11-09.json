You probably need more context: many of the girls I have observed decline dancing with black dudes every freaking time. it absolutely is about race. Is that sad? yes! Should it change? Absolutely.\n\nAt the end of  the day, people of any 'racial group' [in the US] attribute so much to the bullshit they read in the media about people of other races.  This is very different from my experience when I was based in Germany, where most people I met were actually curious about who I was than how closely related I were to some bullshit stat they read about those who looked like me on a tabloid.\n\nWhat I am saying is that I have had to prove to lame grils here that I wasn't a 'thug' before they would actually dance with me, Now, that's bullshit.", "comments": 4, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 0, "page_engaged_users": 0, "page_views": 0, "page_consumption": 0}}, {"created_time": "2015-11-09T14:52:05+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_968196256582755", "message": "#2540 @2529 you think just because you won a bunch of dance competitions and \"got moves\" that you're entitled to my body on the dance floor?

You've got no business telling me who I should or shouldn't be dancing with, the only person with the power to decide that is me.
