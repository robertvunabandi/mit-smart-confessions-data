I know that comparing myself to the average MIT student isn't indicative of anything, and that's not the problem. I just feel like the material moves so fast in all of my classes that I have to half ass a lot of my psets. I don't have time to study, and once I get a few days behind, I have to give up on deep understanding to just get through the semester. I know I'm a reasonably smart person. If given adequate time to learn the material (which is assumed review for many), I'd do fine. It almost makes me wish I would have gone to an easier school, so I could have learned more. I haven't seriously thought about transferring becuase the people here are so great.
