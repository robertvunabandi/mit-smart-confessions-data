Call me egoistic, but I consider myself as one capable, highly intelligent young mind that actually understands how this world works. \n''You don't know shit'' - you must be thinking, but I'm not even gonna try to change your mind, since all of us have those defense mechanisms that tell us no one could have a better understanding of the world than ourselves, right?
