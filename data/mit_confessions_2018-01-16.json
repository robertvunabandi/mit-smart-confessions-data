Yeah Latino != White but even then Latino may not be specific enough. Are you talking about fair skinned Hispanics , who are quite frankly probably >75% European anyway. Cause yeah Spanish/Portuguese is Iberian and Iberian is white. A lot of Spanish have Arab, and Arab is also white soooo. You have motherfuckers in Cuba and Argentina that are like 100% European, and then you have the real og \"Brown People\" who are not even on social media because they're still stuck in places like Oaxaca or Arequipa. Even when talking about the whities, socioeconomic status is important cause a white guy from a ranch in Nuevo Leon != white guy from Polanco, Mexico City. Hey and honestly, I don't like the G word man. We should all respect each other. Commenters, what should we call American Whites when specificity is required such as in the Puerto Rico confession?
