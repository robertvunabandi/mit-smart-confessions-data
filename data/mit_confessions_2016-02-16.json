    "message": "#3800 It's SO RIDICULOUSLY HARD to get out of bed in the morning because it's so cold outside. I'm scared that the temperature is just an excuse for me to be unproductive and shirk my responsibilities (like not go to class) so I've been putting a lot of effort into not succumbing to this but it's gotten so much harder!
