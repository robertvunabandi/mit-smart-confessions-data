I was absolutely obsessed with another school till I got into MIT and tbh I love everyone in the '22 groupme so much that I'm losing all motivation to even apply there anymore. I'm an athlete and the coach for that other school convinced me in the summer not to commit to an Ivy and said I should try to get into the harder but more tech-y schools that I love way more, so they're kinda the reason I'm here now. They coach is really rooting for me so I kinda feel like I'd be letting them down if I don't at least try to get in, but I also can't even bring myself to even write a good \"why this school\" essay.

My 3rd party vote was just as valid as a vote for Hillary or Trump. Trump supports say a 3rd party vote was a vote for Hillary, Hillary supporters say it was a vote for Trump. It can't be both ways. Also, a Hillary presidency wasn't exactly a great option either. I see my vote for neither of them as a screw you to the system (obviously who I voted for wasn't going to win, it wasn't about that). It's about time we stop only having two choices, and that's never going to happen if people just continue to choose the lesser of two evils. And before you make the old argument \"\"if you didn't vote for Hillary you don't care about minorities\"\", know that I am a proud queer woman of color. \n\n(@admins I'd really like this posted so if you need to take out the first sentence to do that go ahead :/ but please don't if you don't have to....don't post this request part tho)", "comments": 7, "reactions": {"like": 29, "love": 4, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18800, "page_engaged_users": 5368, "page_views": 7549, "page_consumption": 28154}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-20T03:10:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1634948059907568", "message": "#10793 I'm male-bodied and love presenting fem, but my sexual preference is mostly for the female-bodied.
