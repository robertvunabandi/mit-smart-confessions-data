I cried anytime I was in class, and I cried at night on the days I did skip class. I almost cut myself a few times, but in one of my saner moments I gave my knife away. I talked to a few of my friends about it, but I feel so bad for all my other friends that I lied to. All of the \"stomachaches\" and \"colds\" I made up when they ask me if I had gone to class. I want to tell them so badly, to apologize; but I just can't. I'm so afraid of what they would think of me, eve though I know what what they would say, that it wasn't my fault and they don't blame me. I do though, I blame myself.

Every issue that is common to all college students appear intensified a thousand times in the experience of the MIT student, and it seems that because all are so preoccupied with their work, few have any disposition to provide one another with the time required to support each other's mental health; time that comes naturally to university environments with a weaker work ethic.
