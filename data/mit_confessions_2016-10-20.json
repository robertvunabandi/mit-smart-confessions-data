I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don\u2019t. \n\nPeople don\u2019t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven\u2019t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It\u2019s my fault I\u2019m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I\u2019m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I\u2019ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they\u2019re handling it better than me. I\u2019m probably just weak.\n\nI know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because \"you can't get through MIT alone,\" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.\n\nI already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can\u2019t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it\u2019s their job to make sure that I\u2019m not in any \u201cimmediate danger,\u201d but at the same time, couldn\u2019t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn\u2019t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they \u201ccared.\u201d They don\u2019t really care; It\u2019s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.\n\nNow I\u2019m more depressed than ever. It\u2019s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What\u2019s the point anymore? I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t ask MIT Mental Health help because they\u2019ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can\u2019t talk to friends because they honestly don\u2019t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can\u2019t tell my family because I don\u2019t want them to worry. I\u2019m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can\u2019t concentrate. But at this rate, it\u2019s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness.
