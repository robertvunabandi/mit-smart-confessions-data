At that point we had JUST started dating. I accidentally said \"goodbye! I love you!\". That was the first time I said I love you.  I immediately ran like a block away and just fell to the floor laughing and crying. It was quite a moment. I think about that moment sometimes and think wow, we are so in love right now. What a fuggin comeback. Here's the lesson folks, if the patriots can come back from a 3-28 game in the superbowl, and I can come back from accidentally telling my new SO 'I love you', then we all can come back from anything life throws at us, whether it be a bad grade or a fight with someone you care about or a rejection from your dream job, you can come back from it. We can all come back from anything, just reach out, take care of yourself, and believe. Goodbye, I love you all", "comments": 6, "reactions": {"like": 70, "love": 20, "wow": 1, "haha": 16}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19359, "page_engaged_users": 5170, "page_views": 5737, "page_consumption": 24658}}]
