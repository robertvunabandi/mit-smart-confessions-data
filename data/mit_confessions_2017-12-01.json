She has a shit load of guy friends which  seem to like and respect her. At first I was disappointed that she's a first year, but you would never know it once you get to know her. I just want to lay next to her and have  a conversation with her. It seems like we could be super chill and I could really use a cuddle buddy for starters. Don't even know how to go about doing that. What the hell should I do? I think I fuck'n like this girl because she crosses my mind often and when she comes around to visit, I enjoy seeing her. I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way when she hangs out around here. Fuck, I need words of advice. I think I'm ready to stop fuck'n around.", "comments": 15, "reactions": {"like": 12, "haha": 3}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18524, "page_engaged_users": 5357, "page_views": 6165, "page_consumption": 26096}}]
