They're such a joke. Their algorithms are complete shit, so the trip from anywhere to anywhere else ends up taking double or even triple the time that it bloody well should. If you're in the basement and there's an elevator on the first floor, you can be god damn sure that the elevator from the fifth floor is going to do its damnedest to pick you up, while the elevator on the first floor sits there taking up precious molecules. Even the elevator in Walker Memorial is better than these shitboxes.\n\nWhy haven't these elevators been fixed yet? They are an embarrassment to MIT, which is consistently ranked as one of the best engineering schools globally. Why can't some course 6 students fix this?
