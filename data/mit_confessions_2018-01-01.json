Most of my friends from high school are going to community colleges or state schools and I would argue they're more intelligent and aware than some of the hard-headed students at elite colleges are. They're majoring in astrophysics, engineering, etc. One of my friends reads multiple books in a day and another has learning disabilities but is majoring in nursing with straight A's.
