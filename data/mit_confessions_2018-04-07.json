However, we got to know each other well by texting each other and he told me he liked me. I ignored his texts for a month and during that time because I was super busy and he knew how busy I was and part of me wanted to see if he truly cared about me so I ignored him for a month. During that time he kept sending me funny stories and jokes to make me laugh and I did tell him at one point his texts make me laugh as well as texts to help get me through everything and said if he's texting too much or if I don't feel the same way, just say it and he would stop texting me so much and/or pushing his feelings on me. I never responded so he kept showing me how much he cared for me so I decided to date him despite the relationship being long distance.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 12, "love": 3, "haha": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 24010, "page_engaged_users": 1231, "page_views": 1224, "page_consumption": 3511}}, {"created_time": "2018-04-07T05:44:49+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1747593868642986", "message": "#13203 I wish i had a long cock.
