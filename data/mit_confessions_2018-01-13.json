Don\u2019t think of the number of sororities as an excuse to (ab)use your body to perform these acts.\n\nYou and Your parents worked so hard to get you into MIT, and I don\u2019t think they would be particularly happy to hear that this is the way you spent your first semester.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t shame sororities. It\u2019s not cool. We didn\u2019t join sororities based on sexual rankings. We joined because of the people that make the culture of the house.\n\nPeople can slut-shame you in the comments, but no one did.", "comments": 4, "reactions": {"like": 10, "haha": 9}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19306, "page_engaged_users": 5325, "page_views": 5942, "page_consumption": 23420}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-13T21:55:22+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1659973290738378", "message": "#11622 Has anyone heard anything from the intro to C and c++ class (6.179)???
