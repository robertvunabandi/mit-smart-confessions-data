    "message": "#1723 If you knew who I was, you'd be shocked.  You'd say \"don't do this,\" or \"your life's good, how can you be so selfish to think it's worthless.\"  And it's true.  A lot of people love me.  I have a lot to enjoy now and a lot to look forward to in the future.  But sometimes I feel like it's all worthless just because something small fucked up my whole day or my whole week.  And that little something tends to be connected to a larger problem in my life, like it's indicative of something I hate about myself and that I suspect other people hate.  At moments like these, I sometimes go on Amazon, search \"sleeping pills\", and debate buying a bunch just so I can have a stash if I ever decide to kill myself in the future.  It's not that I thoroughly hate myself.  It's just that sometimes I want to see what would happen if I really was gone forever.  How would my family take it, how would MIT take it, how would my friends take it, how would people in my dorm and especially my hallmates take it?  Honestly, I think there'd be a week at most of sadness and then people would move on, just like when the last couple of students who offed themselves.  So it's really not worth it.  Anyway, I just wanted to speak up anonymously.",

They were my best friends, people I hung out with, people I did my homework with. I cared so much about every single one of them and was there for them all the time. I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?\nNow I see them wear the wristband. And it bothers me so much to see how pretentious they are. This whole movement is really a noble act, but there's only a small percent of people wearing those words know the meaning of them by heart. \nDon't TMAYD MIT. It's all lies.",
