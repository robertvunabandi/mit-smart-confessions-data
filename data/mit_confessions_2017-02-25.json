The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.", "comments": 16, "reactions": {"like": 24, "love": 1, "wow": 1, "haha": 7, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 16412, "page_engaged_users": 1273, "page_views": 985, "page_consumption": 4852}}, {"created_time": "2017-02-25T05:01:02+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1335625686506475", "message": "#9189 Why does MIT's AAA consistently have the most racist sounding events? \"50 Shades of Yellower?\" Last time I checked, no one is actually yellow unless they have something like jaundice.
