    "message": "#8369 I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don\u2019t. \n\nPeople don\u2019t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven\u2019t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It\u2019s my fault I\u2019m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I\u2019m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I\u2019ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they\u2019re handling it better than me. I\u2019m probably just weak.\n\nI know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because \"you can't get through MIT alone,\" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.\n\nI already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can\u2019t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it\u2019s their job to make sure that I\u2019m not in any \u201cimmediate danger,\u201d but at the same time, couldn\u2019t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn\u2019t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they \u201ccared.\u201d They don\u2019t really care; It\u2019s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.\n\nNow I\u2019m more depressed than ever. It\u2019s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What\u2019s the point anymore? I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t ask MIT Mental Health help because they\u2019ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can\u2019t talk to friends because they honestly don\u2019t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can\u2019t tell my family because I don\u2019t want them to worry. I\u2019m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can\u2019t concentrate. But at this rate, it\u2019s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness. When is it all going to be over...",

I honestly answered, \u2018No, this is my first time.\u2019\n\nSo she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.\n\n\u2018Just a minute,\u2019 she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. \u2018Do these excite you?\u2019 She asked.\n\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n\u2018Well, come on\u2019, she said, \u2018We don\u2019t have much time.\u2019 So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.\n\nShe looked at me with a bit of a frown. \u2018Did you put that condom on?\u2019 she asked.\n\nI said, \u2018I sure did,\u2019 and held up my thumb to show her.\n\nShe fainted.",

    "message": "#8689 I don't think anyone expected Trump to actually win, me included. I was really torn this election, but I ended up voting for Trump. Though I don't agree with all of Hillary's policies or all of Trump's, I really did think about this decision hard, and I struggled with it. Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean I think he's anywhere close to a good person. Like many people who voted for Trump, I'm hesitant and worried about our country going forward. His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently. I am not trying to start an argument here, but I wish people who advocate for tolerance and justice would be able to respect that people who voted for Trump had their reasons. They have their values, and you shouldn't just assume yours are better than theirs.",

I think everyone's experience here differs, and I know of quite a few people who feel as though they've gotten opportunities here that they couldn't get anywhere else. I certainly feel like I've had some of those opportunities, but I feel as though there's not really that much positive reinforcement at this school. Throughout my time here, I've simply encountered feedback on how inadequate I was, no matter how hard I try sometimes. I guess it's good to know what my shortcomings are so that I can do better next time, but at the same time, I've never felt so dispassionate about my work as I do now. I've always known that there are lots of things I can improve, but I've rarely had an environment in which essentially everything that I tried to do turned out to be a failure. It's nice to sometimes catch a break.",

I miss cuddling together. I miss so many things. I just wish this would go away. I thought I was getting better, but today I think I had a relapse. I still feel really hurt. Some of the things that happened between us were so painful and at times I was very unhappy with how things were between us. So I guess it was probably for the better.

    "message": "#9191 When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",

I just feel like the material moves so fast in all of my classes that I have to half ass a lot of my psets. I don't have time to study, and once I get a few days behind, I have to give up on deep understanding to just get through the semester. I know I'm a reasonably smart person. If given adequate time to learn the material (which is assumed review for many), I'd do fine. It almost makes me wish I would have gone to an easier school, so I could have learned more. I haven't seriously thought about transferring becuase the people here are so great. Has anyone experienced something similar?",

And I know what it's like to be perpetually lonely.\n\nAll I can say is please, please never give up on yourself. I promise you there are people around you willing to help, even if it doesn't feel like it. I promise you that it can get better, even if you don't see how. Do what you need to get yourself to a happier state -- see Mental Health, leave MIT (temporarily or permanently), take fewer classes, do something that is just for you.

I've always prided myself on being there for my friends though, and as someone who also struggles with mental health, I really want to be there for my friends who struggle with theirs. But I'm realizing it's just not sustainable or practical. I'm only taking 4 classes and I've become minimally involved in extracurriculars, yet I still feel like I constantly have to work and study to get the grades I want. I'm becoming like the people here who prioritize school over friends, people I always used to resent and complain about. Makes me feel hypocritical. IHTFP.

    "message": "#9801 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Weinberg\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they\u2019re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIn contradistinction,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\u2019s for the ladies\u2019 eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e",

She'll get upset if I make plans to hang out with other people and when I invite her, she'll make my friends uncomfortable by acting surly and doesn't attempt to make conversation. She complains a lot about everything--her classes, the people around her, her friends and family back home, even small insignificant things! She always wants to be around me and it's mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with her all the time. I think she acts this way because she doesn't have many friends, but I don't want to be around her all the time with since it's really starting to have a negative impact on daily mood.

I hope everyone, including the BSU, realize that asking any handful of black people how they feel about a topic is not inherently representative of the opinions of black people as a whole, and that it is important to try to convey the diversity of black opinion (e.g. many blacks are fine with the idea of non-blacks wearing dreads)",

That's not to say that you might not be a good match, but stop projecting your idealized traits onto her and making her out to be some perfect person in your mind because the fact is she isn't. You putting her on a pedestal is only going to fuck up any chances you have because you're going to be clingy and needy and seeking validation from her, and idk her so I can't say whether or not she will like the attention at first but she definitely will not truly care for it in the long run. Realize that she's just another human being, and talk to her. Find out who she really is, and if you love that person then go for it, but realize that the girl in your head is not the girl that exists in real life.",

I recently came across a confession where, the OP was considering reporting a HASS class after they had to watch a disturbing movie for it. (It may be appropriate for them to personally skip that particular homework, but I do not believe that the professor is at fault for assigning that movie.)\nOn a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT,  especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.\nI understand that certain things are taboo, sometimes only in specific cultures, and MIT needs maintain their diversity by making everyone feel welcomed. However, censoring out these things would be like avoiding to face reality and, in an academic setting, this may impair the progress that can potentially be made. Thoughts?\n(It would be ironic if my confession got filtered out for bringing this up :/.)",

I sent up an Athena cluster printer to start printing, and then I went back to my computer because fuck standing at a printer waiting for 80 pages to print. After waiting for a bit, I went back to the printer to check on how it was doing, because it was probably close to being done anyways. What greets me is a stack of paper where every single sheet is completely black. I managed to single-handedly eviscerate an entire ink cartridge in one of the printers.\nOops.\nI think it was the weird format of the file that I downloaded that made the Athena printer shit itself. But now you guys know - if you think you've used the most ink out of any student at MIT, you're not even close.",

I loved how my TA would get excited about \"really cool stuff\" like trees and how he'd go off into tangents about research \"that happened really recently actually.\" I even liked that fact that he explained how viruses survive by saying how \"shitty\" they are at checking for mutations. His notes on my PSets would make me smile, especially when he'd put a little smiley face at the end. Giving us sugar and therefore energy from day 1 with those Starbursts, but last last recitation going on about how sugar lobbiests basically brainwashed the country into thinking it was fat that was bad for you (when it was really the sugar.) To this TA, I'd like to tell you that I definitely didn't talk as much in class as I could have, but I legitimately enjoyed recitation so much because you were my TA. Thank you so much for making this an awesome first semester at MIT and tbh, I still have that tiny crush on you.",

I believe I have misinterpreted your friendship and I'm broken hearted by it. I must say there are many things about you that make you stand out from any other girls I have met. I don't know where you get that spirit, energy and love for life. I enjoy how you bring laughter and great conversation to the table. As difficult as it is to write, only because I care for you, as a friend I suggest you focus on the serious candidates and stop spreading yourself thinly amongst the amount of guy friends that you have. I guarantee you these lucky guys who have an opportunity to call you theirs have mixed emotions with your actions towards all your other friends. Guys are guys, they like to talk and would not like for your rep to be attacked. I know you are not about that one bit, and you deserve to be respected, which I would totally do if you had me, but as a friend I would like for you to be more cautious. Trust me, the guy friends you have now will continue  to be your friends because you're you. I for one are one of those friends. Maybe someday you will see me in the same way I see you. If your perspective crushes don't see what a diamond you are, they are absolute tomfools. I for sure see the radiant light that you emit. Only a few days left before you leave and it sucks you won't be around for six weeks, but I can't wait to hear about your travels to San Diego and Israel. I'll anxiously be awaiting your return.",

    "message": "#10783 @10702 Yo, respectfully, f*ck that. My 3rd party vote was just as valid as a vote for Hillary or Trump. Trump supports say a 3rd party vote was a vote for Hillary, Hillary supporters say it was a vote for Trump. It can't be both ways. Also, a Hillary presidency wasn't exactly a great option either. I see my vote for neither of them as a screw you to the system (obviously who I voted for wasn't going to win, it wasn't about that). It's about time we stop only having two choices, and that's never going to happen if people just continue to choose the lesser of two evils. And before you make the old argument \"\"if you didn't vote for Hillary you don't care about minorities\"\", know that I am a proud queer woman of color. \n\n(@admins I'd really like this posted so if you need to take out the first sentence to do that go ahead :/ but please don't if you don't have to....don't post this request part tho)",

I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. \n\nI feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.\n\nThe alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma.

Never knowing if I am saying the right things or if I am really included in the group. This girl though, I just felt comfortable with. I felt like I could say what I wanted to say and I could trust her not judge me and accept me for the weirdo I am. We started talking more and more frequently and each time we talked I enjoyed myself a little more. I started liking her, but I guess I caught the feels too quick and the feeling wasnt mutual. I found out later that she apparently already liked someone else and the more I think about it the more laughable i think it was for me to think I had a chance. But I still like her and I don't know what to do with these bent up feelings. I just want to tell her how much she means to me, but who wants a person, whom they already told they dont like them, confessing to them out of nowhere.

    "message": "#10956 tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life\n\nI wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.\nBut I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.\nBecause the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.\n\nMIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.",

When I ask you, my best friend, out on a date, it's not another person you sorta know asking you out: you don't understand how much I have agonized on the inside, consulted with friends, driven myself to madness, and repeated all the reasons to myself why I should back down and not risk this friendship. To say I have thought long and hard about whether to ask you out is an understatement. So I'm sorry that if after a couple of dates when you say you don't want to continue I am far more emotionally devastated than you could ever understand. And you may think you're helping by giving me space and retreating out of my life, but if you're going to do that, at least say that you are instead of leaving me wondering what I did wrong and confirming the biggest fear about asking you out: that I would lose my best friend. You don't understand the pain I go through every time you say you're not free to hang out, every time you don't want to sit next to me in class, and every time it's made obvious that I care about reestablishing our best friendship way more than you do. I'm over you romantically, but I'm not over losing my best friend. Please do something to show me that you still care",

I understand that this is the reality for most people and I appreciate the opportunities I've been given in this lifetime so far, but it hurts to see my old friends struggling to get by with jobs that they hate and/or wear them out mainly because of the different opportunities that were presented to us at the relatively young age of 17-18.",

They're majoring in astrophysics, engineering, etc. One of my friends reads multiple books in a day and another has learning disabilities but is majoring in nursing with straight A's. We seem to think we're better than those who go to state schools and community colleges because we're at MIT or whatever private university in the surrounding area.

It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. \n\nSo yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of. I need to harden, because people will expect a junior to coddle, not be coddled. I will never have this magical transition so many people have here, and it eats away at me because I missed this fun development process they got through no effort of their own.",

    "message": "#11399 @11359 I'm really curious how common this sort of situation is? I feel like I'm in a similar situation (financially, family used to be doing not so great; parents made a lot of sacrifices and never really did anything for themselves in order to get my siblings and I the best education possible throughout our lives; money used to be hella tight;etc. But now, they're doing much better, and we live comfortably, though still without luxuries like trips or a new car and such), but I get excellent aid (tuition covered, and I cover my expenses + housing with work during the semester + my savings). All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out. Yet, there's been a lot of confessions/comments recently pointing to A LOT of major flaws in the system, and individual cases that were clearly poorly handled by finaid, such as yours.\n\nI'm really curious if there's any sort of complete data/survey information out there that would give a better sense of where these flaws in the system are coming from, and how they could be addressed. Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers. It just seems like looking at the data and figuring out exactly where the problem is will provide the best jumping off point for then starting to go to MIT and ask for change.",

Does anyone know if I can still turn them in (I'm too ashamed to email my professors/TA's, I know this really should be a question for them)?? I know grades were already due, so does this mean I just fail the course? God I feel like such a failure, this has never happened before.I don't know what to do...is this the road to drop out life?",

International students seem to appear significantly stronger on average to a university admissions committee (both undergrad and grad) due to lots of us having shiny Olympiad medals and other achievements that's hard to get in the USA, but lack many essential things that make a student valuable as an intern / hire for a company. Plus a lot of international course 6's are sellouts from course 18 who realize they have no future in math since they are poorly prepared for the rigor, when compared to the non-international course 18's.",

Don\u2019t think of the number of sororities as an excuse to (ab)use your body to perform these acts.\n\nYou and Your parents worked so hard to get you into MIT, and I don\u2019t think they would be particularly happy to hear that this is the way you spent your first semester.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t shame sororities. It\u2019s not cool. We didn\u2019t join sororities based on sexual rankings. We joined because of the people that make the culture of the house.\n\nPeople can slut-shame you in the comments, but no one did.",

Yeah Latino != White but even then Latino may not be specific enough. Are you talking about fair skinned Hispanics , who are quite frankly probably >75% European anyway. Cause yeah Spanish/Portuguese is Iberian and Iberian is white. A lot of Spanish have Arab, and Arab is also white soooo. You have motherfuckers in Cuba and Argentina that are like 100% European, and then you have the real og \"Brown People\" who are not even on social media because they're still stuck in places like Oaxaca or Arequipa. Even when talking about the whities, socioeconomic status is important cause a white guy from a ranch in Nuevo Leon != white guy from Polanco, Mexico City. Hey and honestly, I don't like the G word man. We should all respect each other. Commenters, what should we call American Whites when specificity is required such as in the Puerto Rico confession?

If I tend to find taller men more physically attractive, does this make me racist against any race whose genetic composition makes members of that race, on average, shorter? For clarity, assume I don't have a \"height cutoff\" and can be attracted to shorter men for many other reasons, but height is generally a factor in my physical attraction.\n\nAlso, if I think brown eyes are very beautiful, more so than blue/green/etc eyes, am I being racist against any race whose genetic composition results in predominantly blue eyes?\n\nAt what point do I have the right to be attracted to one person over another without being racist? Why can't I be attracted to certain features more than others, if my attractions are based on those features and not on my knowledge of someone's race? And, since perhaps the genetic makeup of one race results in many people with many of the features I like, why can't I say that I'm more likely to be attracted to a member of that race? Remember, nowhere here have I said that this is a checklist. It's not that I'd *only* be attracted to people of that race. It's simply more likely because statistically there are more people with the features that attract me.",

I think about that moment sometimes and think wow, we are so in love right now. What a fuggin comeback. Here's the lesson folks, if the patriots can come back from a 3-28 game in the superbowl, and I can come back from accidentally telling my new SO 'I love you', then we all can come back from anything life throws at us, whether it be a bad grade or a fight with someone you care about or a rejection from your dream job, you can come back from it. We can all come back from anything, just reach out, take care of yourself, and believe. Goodbye, I love you all",

    "message": "#12015 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Mass Tech. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical campus \"\"hacking\"\" culture most of the jokes will go over a typical student's head. There's also the movement's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - Mass Tech's personal philosophy draws heavily from dormspam flame wars, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Mass Tech truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mass Tech's existencial catchphrase \"\"We Are Mass Tech,\"\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Mass Tech banner unfolds itself over Lobby 7. What fools... how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Mass Tech t-shirt. And no, you cannot see it.

    "message": "#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.\n\nI feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: \n\n1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  \n\n2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to \"do well\" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. \n\nMIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  \n\nBasically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",

Black Panther was an amazing example of how great a story is when you have black actors in black roles. e.g. I'm not saying that we can't have a black James Bond, but just don't call him James Bond.

But now I feel like I finished broadening out and I have no idea what I should be focusing on anymore. Classes just seem like a waste if I can't fold it into a master plan for at least some kind of short term goal. How do people settle on particular passions in life when you've never had a significant life event point you in some direction? I feel like I could pretty much choose anything I want to pursue and be able to succeed, but I can't decide which thing to do. I would normally try to prioritize things I am currently interested and then as I tackle the list, try to pivot as I better learn what I'm interested in, but everything on the list is so close in priority that it seems too arbitrary. Why does person X wanna be a doctor so bad, person Y want to work on AI research, and person Z want to build rocket ships and knew this preference for the last 5 years?\n\nPlz post thoughts and links to things that help answer all this",

The US isn't a Christian nation, so it shouldn't be making rules like one.\n2. Why do people oppose stricter gun laws? A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.\n3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.\n4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US? And why are Asians do complacent in all of this? Asians literally get no benefit from anything race-related in the US: if being a minority is an \"\"advantage,\"\" then Asians don't count (education), yet when being a minority is a disadvantage (otherhood and being targets of racial violence), Asians suddenly become minorities again...

I ignored his texts for a month and during that time because I was super busy and he knew how busy I was and part of me wanted to see if he truly cared about me so I ignored him for a month. During that time he kept sending me funny stories and jokes to make me laugh and I did tell him at one point his texts make me laugh as well as texts to help get me through everything and said if he's texting too much or if I don't feel the same way, just say it and he would stop texting me so much and/or pushing his feelings on me.

I apologize if this somehow comes off as offensive (but I can also see the comments section becoming a frenzy either way).\n\nAt the moment, I imagine that most, if not a lot, of people find that a person's sexuality very important when it comes to finding a suitable partner to have sexual/emotio nal relations with. I think that, for the most part, it would make sense for a person currently undergoing a sexual transition to eventually disclose to the other party (who may or may not be accepting of a gender transition) that they are in fact transgender. \n\nIf in the near future we were able to undergo gender reassignment surgery so perfect that one wouldn't be able to tell a female born at birth vs. male born at birth -> transitioned into a female, then would it/should it be something to be disclosed to others?",

    "message": "#13627 I'm tired of all these \"I shouldn't have been hospitalized, they had no right to do this, don't seek help because you'll be sent to a mental hospital, etc\". First of all, if you're sent to the hospital it's because a professional believes that you cannot keep yourself safe and whether you expressed that to them or not, professionals are trained to recognize when the situation is getting out of hand. Nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but I also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. Spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. Often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. It's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.",

I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement\u2014 please don\u2019t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\n\nAnyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\n\nIf this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\n\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left?

    "message": "#13794 I\u2019m so fucking tired of talk about linear algebra, proprietary software, and all these news articles about Trump\u2019s latest faux pas. I don\u2019t give a single fuck if you prefer vim or emacs or fucking eclipse. I haven\u2019t had a full night\u2019s sleep since before I graduated high school \u2014 fuck \u2014 and for what? This? So I can walk the streets of Cambridge, in the shadow of biotech companies and Google and Microsoft and all kinds of startup shit, suffocating while I\u2019m looking for a place to buy a $6 fucking cup of coffee? How\u2019s a kid supposed to live like this? I grew up loving outer space. I fancied myself an astrophysicist but I never wanted to touch another equation after 8.01. I came here so I could learn how to do anything I wanted, but I feel crippled and pigeonholed into a career where I\u2019ll be another cog in some corporate machine or some soon-to-fail \u201cfreethinking entrepreneur\u201d working at a startup until it is acquired by Facebook for a pittance. Don\u2019t even get me started about grad school. I don\u2019t think I could sit in another lecture if you held me at fucking gunpoint. I\u2019m the loser sitting through commencement, disgusted with myself, ignoring the speaker while all too appropriately surfing Facebook on my fucking iPhone \u2014 I\u2019m such a fucking sellout. I make noise and complain but do nothing. What a waste of space. I just want to sit by the river and read books the rest of my life while all you other kids sit waiting for your code to compile. I want to throw my computer and my brass rat into the Charles instead of turning this pset in. Do you think S^3 would write me a note for that? Sorry Mr. Asshole Professor, I couldn\u2019t do my fucking code review because I drowned my laptop mid-existential crisis; can I have an extra slack day? I\u2019ve laid to rest so many hopes and dreams here, and maybe that\u2019s just fucking growing up. Maybe that\u2019s just fucking life which isn\u2019t fair. Maybe I\u2019ll make mad cash working on an app for people to share memes or maybe I\u2019ll make some rich white dude richer by giving them a few nanoseconds more speed on their trading algorithms. Fuck me! And I swear to GOD if I get another email asking to unsubscribe. I hate the way that tourists clog the hallways, gawking at some lofty, imagined fiction we must all be living. But to live is to suffer and let me swear to you that I am suffering. I\u2019ve sold my soul for a piece of paper and the keys to the city, that is if the city was just some stand-up, networking cocktail hour with hors d'oeuvres that will end up on the free food mailing list which will be quickly claimed by some barefoot EC kid. I\u2019m tired of paragraph-long email signatures. I\u2019m tired of emails. I\u2019m tired of Slack notifications and friend requests. I\u2019m tired of taking pills in the morning and pills at night and pills during the day when it gets hard to breathe and stay upright. All I can think about is receptors and balancing chemical equations all the while wishing I could just be fucking normal. I hate fake friends and best friends who become family only to leave you all but dead in a ditch. To witness just how little we mean to each other is to witness poison seeping through the sidewalks of this city, and the poison absorbs into your body through the soles of your feet with each step you dare take inside city limits. To escape you go somewhere familiar and full of trees. A place where people have backyards and front yards and driveways. The space between houses, the space between your house and the nearest grocery store like a distance between celestial bodies. The clean air and open spaces are somehow suffocating. What is wrong with me? Hell, I\u2019d love to have a work-life balance if only I could think of something to fill my life with. Until then, it doesn\u2019t matter, put me to work with 16-hour days. Please, I beg you. Fill up the hours of the day with something. I just want to be financially stable; I just want to find some contentment with being. I just want to sleep without dreaming.",

This grave mistake must be addressed for the dual connotation of noobishness and disrespect.\n\nI am demanding that in the future all correspondence refrain from this weak terminology in favor of alternative synonyms. Acceptable words include: exciting, enjoyable, or illuminating.\n\nI don't mean to hurt anyone feelings by this, but the greatest authors of English literature did not toil and suffer for the likes of their entomological descendants to barrage the classic language with half baked substitutes for meaningful communication. Shakespeare suffered through a heinous divorce and multiple dead children understanding that his legacy would live on through the power of his invaluable contributions to western culture. Charles Dickens\u2018s father did not beat him and banish him from school so that his literature could be debased by the likes of immature school children not wanting to put forth the effort of a real sentence. Mary Shelley was not blackmailed by her enemies only to be betrayed and back-stabbed by the very individuals she devoted her life to serve.\n\nSo please, l ask of you, remember the great founders of our great culture and language in the future, when you feel so compelled to utilize such base incantations with less meaning than the sum of their letters. Indeed, instead of disgracing our ancestors without even the respect of doing it to their faces, honor them by elevating yourself to the higher standard of distinguished language.\n\nThank you",

We converse after class for some time, sharing mathematical insights; i can keep up. He tells me of great things ahead like series and laplacians. I tell him i already read about series on wikipedia.

All of the deep conversations you people must miss out on because you aren't able to overcome the intellectual IQ barrier that stands in the way of your academic success... it's so sad. Paul and I know each other on first name basis now, but i call him Dr. out of respect.\nAnd yet here you brainlets sit, probably havent even made eye contact with yours out of fear that they will gauge your brainlet IQ levels.\nA true shame, but just know it is because i was born special that i am special.
