Why do people oppose non-traditional marriage? What's it to you if two dudes or two lasses get married? The US isn't a Christian nation, so it shouldn't be making rules like one.\n2. Why do people oppose stricter gun laws? A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.\n3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.\n4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US? And why are Asians do complacent in all of this? Asians literally get no benefit from anything race-related in the US: if being a minority is an \"\"advantage,\"\" then Asians don't count (education), yet when being a minority is a disadvantage (otherhood and being targets of racial violence), Asians suddenly become minorities again...
