I'm now doing well academically for the first time at MIT, but I've seen a clear pattern where I only do well when I shut people out and act selfish. I've always prided myself on being there for my friends though, and as someone who also struggles with mental health, I really want to be there for my friends who struggle with theirs. But I'm realizing it's just not sustainable or practical. I'm only taking 4 classes and I've become minimally involved in extracurriculars, yet I still feel like I constantly have to work and study to get the grades I want. I'm becoming like the people here who prioritize school over friends, people I always used to resent and complain about. Makes me feel hypocritical. IHTFP. Seems like you can't \"succeed\" without being selfish and a low-key shitty friend.
