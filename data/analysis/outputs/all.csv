2016-10-20T00:56:00+0000,"I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don’t. 

People don’t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven’t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It’s my fault I’m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I’m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I’ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they’re handling it better than me. I’m probably just weak.

I know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because ""you can't get through MIT alone,"" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.

I already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can’t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it’s their job to make sure that I’m not in any “immediate danger,” but at the same time, couldn’t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn’t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they “cared.” They don’t really care; It’s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.

Now I’m more depressed than ever. It’s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What’s the point anymore? I don’t know what to do. I can’t ask MIT Mental Health help because they’ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can’t talk to friends because they honestly don’t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can’t tell my family because I don’t want them to worry. I’m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can’t concentrate. But at this rate, it’s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness. When is it all going to be over...",462508190484900_1196469913755387,6,21,4,1,0,0,0,11685,2765,5098,9460,mit_confessions,3081

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.

His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently.

2017-02-25T05:02:00+0000,"When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",462508190484900_1335626033173107,16,24,1,1,7,0,0,16412,1273,985,4852,mit_confessions,2795

I saw you... MIT students, everywhere. I know how shitty this place can be (hell, I'm a 3-time CAP warning champion). I know how shitty one's brain can be. And I know what it's like to be perpetually lonely.

All I can say is please, please never give up on yourself. I promise you there are people around you willing to help, even if it doesn't feel like it. I promise you that it can get better, even if you don't see how. Do what you need to get yourself to a happier state -- see Mental Health, leave MIT (temporarily or permanently), take fewer classes, do something that is just for you. But please, do not give up.

2017-11-14T06:50:00+0000,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student’s head. There’s also Weinberg’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they’re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg’s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg’s existential catchphrase “In contradistinction,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg’s genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

I recently came across a confession where, the OP was considering reporting a HASS class after they had to watch a disturbing movie for it. (It may be appropriate for them to personally skip that particular homework, but I do not believe that the professor is at fault for assigning that movie.)
On a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT,  especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.
I understand that certain things are taboo, sometimes only in specific cultures, and MIT needs maintain their diversity by making everyone feel welcomed. However, censoring out these things would be like avoiding to face reality and, in an academic setting, this may impair the progress that can potentially be made. Thoughts?

I sent up an Athena cluster printer to start printing, and then I went back to my computer because fuck standing at a printer waiting for 80 pages to print. After waiting for a bit, I went back to the printer to check on how it was doing, because it was probably close to being done anyways. What greets me is a stack of paper where every single sheet is completely black. I managed to single-handedly eviscerate an entire ink cartridge in one of the printers.

I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. 

I feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.

The alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma.

2017-12-23T14:00:00+0000,"tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life

I wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.
But I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.
Because the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.

MIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.",462508190484900_1637818126287228,3,180,25,0,0,0,0,18878,5755,6734,27159,mit_confessions,3411

2018-01-03T06:27:00+0000,"@my earlier confession about being jealous of people who were lonely but then come here, find a group, and blossom:

Constantly looking for a group like this ruins the magic.  It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. 

So yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of. I need to harden, because people will expect a junior to coddle, not be coddled.

I feel like I'm in a similar situation (financially, family used to be doing not so great; parents made a lot of sacrifices and never really did anything for themselves in order to get my siblings and I the best education possible throughout our lives; money used to be hella tight;etc. But now, they're doing much better, and we live comfortably, though still without luxuries like trips or a new car and such), but I get excellent aid (tuition covered, and I cover my expenses + housing with work during the semester + my savings). All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out. Yet, there's been a lot of confessions/comments recently pointing to A LOT of major flaws in the system, and individual cases that were clearly poorly handled by finaid, such as yours.

I'm really curious if there's any sort of complete data/survey information out there that would give a better sense of where these flaws in the system are coming from, and how they could be addressed. Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers.

For clarity, assume I don't have a ""height cutoff"" and can be attracted to shorter men for many other reasons, but height is generally a factor in my physical attraction.

Also, if I think brown eyes are very beautiful, more so than blue/green/etc eyes, am I being racist against any race whose genetic composition results in predominantly blue eyes?

At what point do I have the right to be attracted to one person over another without being racist? Why can't I be attracted to certain features more than others, if my attractions are based on those features and not on my knowledge of someone's race? And, since perhaps the genetic makeup of one race results in many people with many of the features I like, why can't I say that I'm more likely to be attracted to a member of that race? Remember, nowhere here have I said that this is a checklist. It's not that I'd *only* be attracted to people of that race.

2018-01-25T07:01:34+0000,"Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.

I feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: 

1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  

2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to ""do well"" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. 

MIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  

Basically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",462508190484900_1671403616262012,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,19417,4180,4630,16286,mit_confessions,1844

[3] Inability to find a life partner despite numerous sincere efforts
[4] Always investing in other people's well-being and putting myself second while getting very little in return (closely related to [3] )

While I can identify causes, I cannot get myself out. The anxiety is taking a heavy toll on my life and potential and making me into a shell of who I was 10 years ago. There's no way around it: I need therapy.

1. Why do people oppose non-traditional marriage? What's it to you if two dudes or two lasses get married? The US isn't a Christian nation, so it shouldn't be making rules like one.
2. Why do people oppose stricter gun laws? A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.
3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.
4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US? And why are Asians do complacent in all of this? Asians literally get no benefit from anything race-related in the US: if being a minority is an """"advantage,"""" then Asians don't count (education), yet when being a minority is a disadvantage (otherhood and being targets of racial violence), Asians suddenly become minorities again...

I’m posting on here because I’m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement— please don’t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don’t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(

Anyways, on with the question. I’m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don’t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in “female” activities such as putting on make up, liking “girlish” colors, and “speaking” like a girl? I guess what I’m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?

If this is the case, then why can’t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) “him” a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming “transgender (in this sense)?” Isn’t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?

TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain “gender,” even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn’t exist according to the left? Please don’t hate on me :(",462508190484900_1793875667348139,3,17,2,0,0,0,0,24364,1059,1261,3351,mit_confessions,1890

2018-07-20T13:42:00+0000,"I’m so fucking tired of talk about linear algebra, proprietary software, and all these news articles about Trump’s latest faux pas. I don’t give a single fuck if you prefer vim or emacs or fucking eclipse. I haven’t had a full night’s sleep since before I graduated high school — fuck — and for what? This? So I can walk the streets of Cambridge, in the shadow of biotech companies and Google and Microsoft and all kinds of startup shit, suffocating while I’m looking for a place to buy a $6 fucking cup of coffee? How’s a kid supposed to live like this? I grew up loving outer space. I fancied myself an astrophysicist but I never wanted to touch another equation after 8.01. I came here so I could learn how to do anything I wanted, but I feel crippled and pigeonholed into a career where I’ll be another cog in some corporate machine or some soon-to-fail “freethinking entrepreneur” working at a startup until it is acquired by Facebook for a pittance. Don’t even get me started about grad school. I don’t think I could sit in another lecture if you held me at fucking gunpoint. I’m the loser sitting through commencement, disgusted with myself, ignoring the speaker while all too appropriately surfing Facebook on my fucking iPhone — I’m such a fucking sellout. I make noise and complain but do nothing. What a waste of space. I just want to sit by the river and read books the rest of my life while all you other kids sit waiting for your code to compile. I want to throw my computer and my brass rat into the Charles instead of turning this pset in. Do you think S^3 would write me a note for that? Sorry Mr. Asshole Professor, I couldn’t do my fucking code review because I drowned my laptop mid-existential crisis; can I have an extra slack day? I’ve laid to rest so many hopes and dreams here, and maybe that’s just fucking growing up. Maybe that’s just fucking life which isn’t fair. Maybe I’ll make mad cash working on an app for people to share memes or maybe I’ll make some rich white dude richer by giving them a few nanoseconds more speed on their trading algorithms. Fuck me! And I swear to GOD if I get another email asking to unsubscribe. I hate the way that tourists clog the hallways, gawking at some lofty, imagined fiction we must all be living. But to live is to suffer and let me swear to you that I am suffering. I’ve sold my soul for a piece of paper and the keys to the city, that is if the city was just some stand-up, networking cocktail hour with hors d'oeuvres that will end up on the free food mailing list which will be quickly claimed by some barefoot EC kid. I’m tired of paragraph-long email signatures. I’m tired of emails. I’m tired of Slack notifications and friend requests. I’m tired of taking pills in the morning and pills at night and pills during the day when it gets hard to breathe and stay upright. All I can think about is receptors and balancing chemical equations all the while wishing I could just be fucking normal. I hate fake friends and best friends who become family only to leave you all but dead in a ditch. To witness just how little we mean to each other is to witness poison seeping through the sidewalks of this city, and the poison absorbs into your body through the soles of your feet with each step you dare take inside city limits. To escape you go somewhere familiar and full of trees. A place where people have backyards and front yards and driveways. The space between houses, the space between your house and the nearest grocery store like a distance between celestial bodies. The clean air and open spaces are somehow suffocating. What is wrong with me? Hell, I’d love to have a work-life balance if only I could think of something to fill my life with. Until then, it doesn’t matter, put me to work with 16-hour days. Please, I beg you. Fill up the hours of the day with something. I just want to be financially stable; I just want to find some contentment with being.

I am demanding that in the future all correspondence refrain from this weak terminology in favor of alternative synonyms. Acceptable words include: exciting, enjoyable, or illuminating.

I don't mean to hurt anyone feelings by this, but the greatest authors of English literature did not toil and suffer for the likes of their entomological descendants to barrage the classic language with half baked substitutes for meaningful communication. Shakespeare suffered through a heinous divorce and multiple dead children understanding that his legacy would live on through the power of his invaluable contributions to western culture. Charles Dickens‘s father did not beat him and banish him from school so that his literature could be debased by the likes of immature school children not wanting to put forth the effort of a real sentence. Mary Shelley was not blackmailed by her enemies only to be betrayed and back-stabbed by the very individuals she devoted her life to serve.

So please, l ask of you, remember the great founders of our great culture and language in the future, when you feel so compelled to utilize such base incantations with less meaning than the sum of their letters. Indeed, instead of disgracing our ancestors without even the respect of doing it to their faces, honor them by elevating yourself to the higher standard of distinguished language.

The culture I'm talking about is the one where everyone tries their best to skirt direct language when they know it's going to hurt someone's feelings. It's so fucking tiring and difficult to have to think about how I can tell you that your contribution to this group project is fucking garbage and that everything you've done is completely pointless without hurting your feelings. And this is only one symptom of the culture. Tiptoeing around these issues in person is the reason Timely confessions was so toxic; because noone was willing to own up to their own opinions for fear of being disagreed with. It's disgusting.

I ask Professor Seidel his thoughts on quantum mechanics and partial derivatives. He's impressed i know about the subject. We converse after class for some time, sharing mathematical insights; i can keep up. He tells me of great things ahead like series and laplacians. I tell him i already read about series on wikipedia. He is yet again impressed at my enthusiasm. What a joy it is to have your professor visibly brighten when he learns of your talents.
And now I sit here wondering what it must be like to be a brainlet, unable to engage your professor as an intellectual peer.

N/A,"I'm attracted to my own sex (male, if anyone was wondering). I've known this for a while now, about seven years. I've never really known what to do about it other than hide it. In middle and high school, I feared I'd be alienated, abandoned, persecuted, or harassed. Now I'm done my first year of college and I still don't know what to do.
Life at home can be summed up in one word: ""Christian."" Whatever preconceived notions you may have of the faith, or of faith in general, I want to try to get across my personal experience with it and how it affects me. My siblings and I did the whole ""church"" thing growing up: weekly Sunday school, church with family, prayers before every meal, and the Lord's Prayer before bedtime. We all even went/are going to Christian private schools from Pre-K to 12.
For some reason, I took it upon myself to be the best Christian I could possibly be: memorizing Scripture, reciting the Ten Commandments and Fruit of the Spirit as if they were the Pledge of Allegiance, and keeping close to my heart each lesson and sermon I was taught. I don't know why it was so important to me. Looking back, it probably had less to do with my own faith and growth as a person and more to do with being the most respected child when surrounded by adults.
This happened until I was around twelve during middle school. I won't go into the details of my sexual awakening. The important part is that I felt trapped. I didn't think my parents or friends would understand. I certainly didn't want to confide in my teachers or church leaders, so I felt alone. 
As a result I spent a lot of sermons over the next few years thinking about myself and what it really meant to be a Christian. Every now and then there would be a sermon about how members of the congregation should interact with homosexuals and what the Bible says about homosexuality. But I soon learned that different pastors will often derive different conclusions to the same issue; thus, I felt even more alone. Honestly, I still don't know my own place in the faith.
Even with the friends I made, I felt like an imposter. My core group of friends, who I love to death, do not know about me. Before my senior year, I didn't think anyone would stand by me if I came out. I thought people would see me as filthy or sinful or something like that. But when I finally got it through my thick skull that they really have my back, I felt ashamed for thinking otherwise. I felt like I betrayed them somehow, that the person they've been laughing with for years is really a mannequin made for show. I don't know what telling them could do to each of our individual friendships, so I'm still doing what I've always done: hiding. It's selfish of me, I know. Maybe I'm just a coward.
One of those friends taught me just how devastating a crush could be. I don't even remember when it happened, but one day I just started seeing him as a romantic interest. Pushing back my feelings, I determined that all I'd ever be was a good friend, so I did that. I helped him with family issues, his own romance woes, academic trouble, all the while secretly pining for him. The story doesn't end well, as you probably already know. At the start of junior year, I determined that it was unhealthy for me to be around him all the time, so I distanced myself from him to try and get over my now three-year-long crush. Less than a month later, he got himself expelled and was disowned by his parents not too long after. Since then, I've seen him a handful of times, and each time I feel guilty. I feel guilty for not being a better friend and for having feelings that I felt I shouldn't have had in the first place.
Ever since then I've felt lost, like I'm searching for a new goal to aspire to or a place to call a home. I haven't found it. In my house, I just find my own corner and hope to be left alone. At church, I sit and just count the moments until service is over. And when I'm hanging out with friends, I feel like a cardboard version of myself.
And that brings me here to MIT. Now I'm in college, my first year down and I'm still hiding. I know people who state their identities proudly, and I envy them greatly. I wish that, for a moment, I could be like them. That I could be brave enough tell the world who I am without being afraid of any repercussions. That I could have enough self-certainty to tell everyone what I believe in and why. That I could walk confidently enough to not second guess my own decisions in life. 
But I'm not like those people. I'm not like most of you. I have no voice. I have no self-assurance. I have no presence. I guess I've gotten good at hiding.",462508190484900_1802246036511102,7,6,13,0,0,17,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,4642

N/A,"As a moderate conservative, it's been difficult for me to understand one part of the transgender movement. I'm posting on here because I'm looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement— please don't hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don't mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(

Anyways, on with the question. I'm confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don't necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in ""female"" activities such as putting on make up, liking ""girlish"" colors, and ""speaking"" like a girl? I guess what I'm asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?

If this is the case, then why can't we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) ""him"" a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming ""transgender (in this sense)?"" Isn't that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?

TLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain ""gender,"" even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn't exist according to the left?

First of all, if you're sent to the hospital it's because a professional believes that you cannot keep yourself safe and whether you expressed that to them or not, professionals are trained to recognize when the situation is getting out of hand. Nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but I also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. Spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. Often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. It's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.",462508190484900_1786624751406564,3,15,0,0,0,0,4,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1165

N/A,"I feel like a lot of people who have been involuntarily hospitalized while at MIT may have just not known the right things to say. If you're talking about suicidal thoughts, they need to actually have reasonable suspicion that you are willing and able to go through with it before they can commit you.

BUT of course I would never ever actually do it, I wouldn't want to hurt my family like that, and I've never really considered how I would practically do it!!!"""" Or, for psychosis, """"I often have visual and auditory hallucinations... BUT I know they're not real, they haven't gotten any worse lately, and since I know they're fake I would never listen to anything they say!!!"""" (Also, never never never crack jokes about suicide or self-harm around your therapist/doctor.

N/A,"Good mental health is a two way street. It's important for MIT to provide good mental services that acknowledge the students problems and help them solve them. MIT can't possibly check up on each student when they don't show up to class, clubs, friend activities (otherwise, we'd be suing MIT for privacy violation). Also, it's not up to MIT to solve a person's mental health problem, that's for a trained clinician to do (otherwise, we'd all be saying it's okay to have a someone who is not a physician be your primary care doctor). Applying a slippery slope argument to MIT's court case doesn't help solve this issue (i.e. #13551). Also saying that MIT shouldn't prohibit contact between sexual assault victim and accuser and arguing that closing senior haus leads to more suicide seriously makes me concerned about your logic. Blaming Reif for every suicide also doesn't help students (#13550). In fact, if we keep on hating on the administration, it only makes those who are struggling less willing to seek out help because of all the antidotal things they hear/read. The onus is also up to us students to work with Reif and be reasonable. MIT already has pretty loose policies. Honestly, not many other school has an S^3 that is as supportive as ours (if they even have one), or the fact that you can drop a class one month before finals? Can MIT do more? Yes, but continue to blame MIT for everything you don't agree on makes me more concerned about your mental state than MIT's policies. Having so much hate never leads to good outcomes... Good mental health is also on the student to recognize when he/she needs help. And yes, from first hand experience, I know that's easier said than done. But not acknowledging your problems or refusing help makes it harder for someone else recognizing it and help you. MIT is there to support us, not coddle us. MIT is hard, but we also have to be okay with who we are and find help when we don't think we can do it alone (look, we all were the top of the class in high school and now, we're in a place where everyone else was also at the top). Blindly blaming MIT for suicides is unfair. We have to have a conversation, not a shouting match.

N/A,"I've tried everything I can to be happy, but I'm just falling deeper into my own despair. I feel like I'm losing my mind, that I'm completely disconnected from the people around me, from my friends. I've spent the last few nights having breakdowns and crying myself to sleep because the loneliness is just getting too unbearable. I open up messenger wanting to message someone but my mind goes blank with nothing to talk about, or full of anxiety that I'm going to say something stupid. It seems like everyone is busy with their own work, or busy with people who actually have interesting lives. I instead blurt out off-handed remarks, make things awkward and just generally make myself look like a shitty person. I never feel like I can get close enough to people for them to actually give two shits about me—I could disappear and nothing would change. I don't know if it's just me; that I am in some way unwanted or undesirable. I either feel like a burden or an afterthought, cuz I have yet to find someone who actually appreciates my presence and isn't simply apathetic to it. I can't get anything done because I'm always so burnt out—not because of the work, but because of the complete lack of emotional support. I hate how I can solve any of my other problems but not ones involving my emotions, especially since this feels the only thing holding me back from living a normal life. I've been seeing someone at medical for a while now, but they simply can't medicate or talk away external factors. It is this very loneliness that pushed me to attempt a few times in the past, and I feel like I'm slipping now: I've been getting random thoughts about what might happen if I'm gone and I've only seen people feel guilt over not giving me enough attention, but where are these people now? I'm sick and tired of being told that I'm """"just looking for attention"""" by people who have never been ignored in their life. Of course, I don't want to end it all; I know there are many things in life to live for. I just want this pain to end.

1. Why do people oppose non-traditional marriage? What's it to you if two dudes or two lasses get married? The US isn't a Christian nation, so it shouldn't be making rules like one.
2. Why do people oppose stricter gun laws? A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.
3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.
4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US?

N/A,"I'm Ring Comm from a year that's still on campus, and while I think they did one or two things right, I really don't like the 20's design. I would love to talk to them directly, but I don't believe they could do anything with my input now. 

Every other year has put hard work and design time into amazing rings, before and after my class, but I agree with the """"vocal minority"""" that this year doesn't justify that effort. I'd also like to highlight the term """"vocal minority"""". I too, was once upset to hear negative feedback on confessions about our ring (it will always happen) especially on things I personally put a lot of thought into. I entirely entirely entirely understand how the 20's might feel, but you should not neglect, invalidate, or simply brush off the negative feedback by calling it irrelevant altogether. You should learn from these comments, from both the good and upsetting. 

One of our interview questions was literally how we would react and what actions we would take given overwhelmingly negative feedback.... and while I think the response this year certainly borders more on """"overwhelmingly negative"""" than the historic """"vocal minority"""", I'd understand if the committee didn't see it worth changing -- you can't make everyone happy. That's up to your discretion. 

I'm sorry 20's. I wish Ring Comm had a better mentorship structure where future years could get better guidance from the old folks. I would have loved to help or provide my feedback once or twice while I could, and part of me feels like I've let old Ring Committees down by not helping perpetuate a certain culture of design. 

Maybe the 21's will learn from the overwhelming feedback and change for the better. Best of luck.",462508190484900_1698761516859555,3,14,0,1,1,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1724

N/A,"Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.

I feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: 

1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  

2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to ""do well"" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. 

MIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  

Basically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",462508190484900_1671403616262012,6,6,0,0,0,0,1,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1844

N/A,"@11359 I'm really curious how common this sort of situation is? I feel like I'm in a similar situation (financially, family used to be doing not so great; parents made a lot of sacrifices and never really did anything for themselves in order to get my siblings and I the best education possible throughout our lives; money used to be hella tight;etc. But now, they're doing much better, and we live comfortably, though still without luxuries like trips or a new car and such), but I get excellent aid (tuition covered, and I cover my expenses + housing with work during the semester + my savings). All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out. Yet, there's been a lot of confessions/comments recently pointing to A LOT of major flaws in the system, and individual cases that were clearly poorly handled by finaid, such as yours.

I'm really curious if there's any sort of complete data/survey information out there that would give a better sense of where these flaws in the system are coming from, and how they could be addressed. Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers. It just seems like looking at the data and figuring out exactly where the problem is will provide the best jumping off point for then starting to go to MIT and ask for change.",462508190484900_1651998991535808,2,15,2,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2434

Constantly looking for a group like this ruins the magic.  It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. 

So yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of.

N/A,"tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life

I wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.
But I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.
Because the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.

MIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.",462508190484900_1637818126287228,3,168,25,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,3411

N/A,"As a person from a lower socioeconomic class, I feel intensely compelled to get everything I can out of my college experience. I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. 

I feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.

The alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma.

I recently came across a confession where, the OP was considering reporting a HASS class after they had to watch a disturbing movie for it. (It may be appropriate for them to personally skip that particular homework, but I do not believe that the professor is at fault for assigning that movie.)
On a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT,  especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.
I understand that certain things are taboo, sometimes only in specific cultures, and MIT needs maintain their diversity by making everyone feel welcomed. However, censoring out these things would be like avoiding to face reality and, in an academic setting, this may impair the progress that can potentially be made. Thoughts?

N/A,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student's head. There's also Weinberg's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they're not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg's lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg's existential catchphrase ""In contradistinction,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg's genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

N/A,"When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",462508190484900_1335626033173107,16,16,1,1,7,0,1,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2795

His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently.

N/A,"I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don't. 

People don't seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven't made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It's my fault I'm so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I'm just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I've only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they're handling it better than me. I'm probably just weak.

I know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because ""you can't get through MIT alone,"" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.

I already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can't they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it's their job to make sure that I'm not in any ""immediate danger,"" but at the same time, couldn't they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn't even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they ""cared."" They don't really care; It's just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.

Now I'm more depressed than ever. It's so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What's the point anymore? I don't know what to do. I can't ask MIT Mental Health help because they'll just send me to a mental hospital. I can't talk to friends because they honestly don't care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can't tell my family because I don't want them to worry. I'm not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can't concentrate. But at this rate, it's so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness.

I mean, like I'm happy they're independent and have grown out of needing their family, but I never got to grow out of needing my family. I took care of my parents, not really the other way around, and it bums me out sometimes. 

I'd give anything to know what it's like to call your mom at the end of the day and talk about school and life and the cute guy that I'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation end in an ""I love you, no matter what anyone tells you, you're doing great.""

But we don't live in a vacuum as much as this page suggests.  I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention.  Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone.  You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.

N/A,"Every semester I've been here I've gotten an email from a concerned professor about my performance. This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.

But I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, ""just get higher scores."" Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.

N/A,"So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there? 

I am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.

I get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not ""anti-America"" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.

I'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant.

N/A,"to #6284 - I think it's important to realize that MIT is a very large institution, and that these changes to security, dining plan policy, and fossil free MIT thing are not something that happen overnight. It took MIT over 3 years to make Add/Drop forms be online.  It still hasn't done this for minor forms.  If that takes at least 3 years then even considering a change to any of the things you listed will take well over that amount of time.  In a way, it is discouraging. But I think the better way to think about it is that the world won't change overnight either - it should be a lesson of perseverance and determination to enact change and not get discouraged if it takes a really long time.  

To be clear though, I'm not justifying MIT's slowness to change. I'm against huge bureaucracies for this reason. I'm also not a fan of saying at least we're more progressive than the Ivies where it takes even longer to change things.

N/A,"This issue has been on my mind for a long time and after watching the last democratic debate, I realized I had to make this post. I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. 

While I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Buñuel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by ""greedy"" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. 

No Bernie, I refuse to ""feel the bern"", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.

Instead, I found my dean was incredibly emotionally manipulative, making me think I couldn't handle what had happened and needed more drastic measures (going to mental health, time off, regular meetings). I wondered (and still do) if this sort of emotional manipulation is why so many MIT students are dependent on S^3 deans. 

I made up some lame excuse about having a meeting and eventually ghosted them when the dean kept asking for follow-up meetings, and never went back, even when stuff got rough over the next four years.

N/A,"Both political parties have good ideas, take the best from each.

Those of you on the left, understand that the right wants to maintain the society we have. We want a society that allows free discourse of all ideas. A society that is tolerant of all ideas cannot import people who are intolerant of all ideas, as that is destructive to that society. Whether you wish to acknowledge it or not, Western liberal ideas are primarily held by those who are from Western liberal societies and those that have been influenced by Western liberal societies. Immigrants must assimilate into our culture for our society to survive. Most individuals from certain cultural backgrounds have shown themselves incapable of assimilation. We cannot allow these people into our society. A tolerant society paradoxically must be intolerant of those who are intolerant.

Those on the right, understand that the left is fighting for equality of opportunity for all people regardless of who you are. Just as you are opposed to socialism because it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who do not, you must also be opposed to allowing dynasties of elites to form, as is the case in libertarian societies. When your parents die, you receive money you did not work for. You have no claim to that money, and thus a society must make the funds available to the public. Give every individual the chance to become a leader. Competition breeds strength.

The Meritocracy Party is the only political organization promoting an agenda that will eliminate dynasties of wealth, provide equal opportunity to all people, and maintain our society and culture.",462508190484900_1026950387374008,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1636

Being that it is February and the weather is to some degree getting a tad bit warmer I decided that perhaps the time hap come to wear something a tad bit more comfortable and possibly a little more revealing. I looked into my closet and found y wardrobe for that day. I exited my dorm room at exactly 10:15 on the dot yesterday. I'd been invited to Charlestown for a party that was to be held by my roommates cousin. Being a stranger to Boston, having resided down south in Houston, Texas all my life I had no knowledge of Charlestown.

I don't rember the exact definition she gave me as to what this particular breed of man was. I'm not even concerned with the definition she gave me. What mattered was his comment. a comment so vulgar, so dehumanizing, so nasty that it makes me insides boil up like hot water, my head burn like fire, and my entie body to shake with rage and fury.

In 1989 during a live television broadcast of the David lettermen show, the host in question had the audacity to remark on the current weight of one oprah winfrey and furthermore thought his comments to be justified. she said ""Fuck That"" So when this spineless, needledick dweeb had the audacity to sit on his stoop and call out to me in such a manner I did what women throughout history have and I pray, will continue to do when a man feels that he can speak to you in a dehumanizing matter.

N/A,"The issue with modern day social justice techniques:
I can't tell what is being asked of me.
I feel like things are more relatable if you ask for some well-defined goal to be met. For example, wanting women to have the right to vote. That is a goal with clear metrics and observable change. It is immediately understood if the goal is met or not.
Now, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate ""we will overcome this"" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used. I think, for the sake of everyone, it is better to at least define some goals, even if they are a proxy for what is actually desired. I understand things are complex... But I will only ever live within my own set of experiences, so the more relatable and understandable your problems are to me, the more I will naturally support your side. I feel hesitation and uncertainty when I try to support something that sounds abstract and purely subjective.
By the way, I actually think this approach will gain a larger and more diverse following. Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change.

Seeing the stark contrast between how we feel about our house team and the BC people, how many haus people respond to haus confessions in fun ways, it hits home that the reason I'm still here is because there's no other place that I could imagine being even relatively happy. I'd rather be holed up in my room psetting/studying 80% of the day here than anywhere else because, at the end of the day, yes, it is the most unique place I've ever seen.",462508190484900_985311168204597,3,67,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1323

N/A,"We are jealous of friends at other colleges that have naked runs around finals.  So let's have one at MIT!  We will start a tradition, the Infinite Streak, that on the night before finals begin every term (Sunday, Dec 13, this term), we meet in Lobby 7 just before 10pm, and at exactly 10pm, strip naked, and run down the Infinite and back.  All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc.  Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.
(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again.  What do I wear when I show up?  Clothes or a towel.  Where do I leave the clothes?  In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends.  Why doesn't the run go outside?  Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside.  What about cameras?  Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them.  Do I have to be totally naked?  It's encouraged, but we certainly can't require it.)

Why can't I feel as if I've done poorly if I didn't live up to my potential, no matter how far above or below average I was?

N/A,"I am an Evangelical Christian here on campus. I don't hide what I am, and most of my friends here are agnostic or atheist. We all get along just fine. One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, ""why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes"". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, ""fun"", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, ""My Kingdom is not of this world"". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things? If you ask why you haven't heard of them it's because they collapse almost as fast as they rise. People stay faithful because faith challenges them, not tells them what they want to hear.

N/A,"2888, I still have nightmares about you, not super often, but still.  Either aboutsomehow ""accidentally"" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had.  I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship.  Never treat someone how you treated me.  Your last message makes me hope you did learn.  You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.  

I want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else:  No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety.  I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them.  Do not let them hold you hostage by your love.  If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them.  Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff.  If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly.  If they say, ""if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]"", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you.  Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real.  If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change.  You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again.  Leave them.  Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it.  Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more.  Never let fear control you.  

If you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR.  They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually  really difficult if you are blinded by love.  Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you.  Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.

I still remember but what I can see clearly now is all of the abuse you put me through. That was some text book emotional abuse and it wasn't OK and I will never stay with someone who does even a fraction of what you used to do.  That's why its so easy now to forget you.  After I stopped caring about you I was alone and it was beautiful.  To not have to fucking answer to anyone.  And then I met someone and I fell in love again.  Its different and so much better.

Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).

To argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.

I just wanted to articulate this distinction.

The roaring laughter that ensues, is not only confusing, but painful to me because I feel that this joke hugely undermines the progress MIT has made towards racial inclusion. 

I'm not the best at discussing whats racist and whats not--I find my emotions usually get the best of me in these conversations. In the face of these issues, I usually just shrug my shoulders and learn to live with the harm. I'm not trying to impose on his freedom of speech, I just am fearful of what harm this might propagate when you have a very admired professor at a world class institution showing his students that there is no harm caused when making jokes like this.

I almost want to post a link of the joke here (its on OCW and youtube, which is how I suspect he makes the same joke every year), but I'm not sure if it would do any good to publicly shame him and have people comment on his specific word use or debate whether or not what he said was actually harmful. But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that ""all asians look the same"" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.

Its been a year now, and these memories and this pain still resurfaces whenever conversations of race come up in the news. These videos are still on youtube.

I've spoken to some other individuals who share my disability, and many of them expressed that they do not feel offended by these appropriative costumes.  Yet, their individual offense is neither necessary nor expected for recognizing offensiveness in general.  It doesn't matter whether they're offended, or even whether the majority of nearsighted individuals are offended.  The only thing that matters is that MIT must make a safe learning space for everyone - including me, and including other nearsighted people who are offended by these costumes, who I'm sure exist but just aren't vocal enough to speak up for themselves.

N/A,"Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the ""Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality"" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said ""A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews"". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was ""venomous"" and a ""disgusting murderer"" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened.",462508190484900_969152453153802,6,81,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,4013

N/A,"Begins rant:

As a black non-American male who can actually dance, [as confirmed by my awards from dancing competitions] lets say I am actually frustrated by the type of girls I meet on the dance floor at MIT and around the Boston area. (Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.

1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another  non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.

2)  The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.

Now, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...
Do you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have. 

This post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.

I feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...

N/A,"After being at MiT for a couple of years I've had a lot experiences that have redefined my self-identity as an academic and a person. We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.

For me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT
may be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching. 

See, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. 
After a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say ""you'll learn through the Pset"" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you  don't even have time to sleep here. 

Now say what you will about MiT needing to be ""rigorous"" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. 
I have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.

Great researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.

N/A,"A lot of people here were their high school's valedictorian and now they come to a place like MIT and realize that they are no longer the best - they may be below average or maybe even average.  And this makes them feel awful but their friends tell them ""you are below average at a top university - you are still above average in a grand sense.""  I also see this ALL the time in comments on this page.

While this *may* be true (I don't 100% believe that, after all STEM !> humanities), it just seems to be a super weird thing to say.  Why is your ""confidence"" based on being better than other people?  Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them.  Like stop.  Stop getting your self worth from being better than other people.  Sometimes you aren't the best.  And that's okay.

I have an older sister who is a freaking prodigy so I had to learn this lesson super young.  I would sometimes say, ""she is really, really smart - she gets things faster than me.""  And my friends and parents would be so concerned about my self-esteem when I said that.  I later had to explain to them that just because I knew I wasn't better at her at school or at music than her didn't mean I wasn't confident in myself.  A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way.  They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best.  And they saw her as a threat.  They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her.  My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.

So how do I get my confidence?  From the knowledge that everyday I am here, I get better than I was yesterday and I test *my* limits.  And my only competition is myself.",462508190484900_962512123817835,3,661,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1947

In this instance, the train by default goes straight. Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.

I think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.

I'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths. I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.

Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. Remember this quote:

""You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting"" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. I mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing.",462508190484900_962510427151338,1,125,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,1851

N/A,"Since I've been here I've felt a bit of culture shock here and there. But not with what I expected. I grew up in a poor family. My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an ""abuse victim"". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from  your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an ""abuse victim"". To compare people smoking cigarettes in front of you to a parent physically harming their child is insulting to people who have had to deal with it.",462508190484900_953750871360627,2,244,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2290

N/A,"I was reading some [census] figures and trends the other day that disturbed me. I have always been a proud atheist, and a activist for atheists. I looked at the US birth rates. Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth.

N/A,"Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here. I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.

One asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.

To answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well.",462508190484900_949064431829271,29,4,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2028

My new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive MIT. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months.

I didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be at MIT?

I realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place.

For the longest time, I loved my dorm, my hall, my hall mates. They were my best friends, people I hung out with, people I did my homework with. I cared so much about every single one of them and was there for them all the time. I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?
Now I see them wear the wristband. And it bothers me so much to see how pretentious they are. This whole movement is really a noble act, but there's only a small percent of people wearing those words know the meaning of them by heart.

There's always the assumption that you're some sort of exotic-seeking-yellow-fever-pervert. ALWAYS.

I've made genuine efforts to be physically attracted to non-asian people but haven't been able to. I'm not sure I fully control that. I REALLY have tried. But my sexual attraction doesn't make any assumptions about your culture or dictate your social worth--it's pretty much based ONLY on what you look like. And apparently, I'm not attracted to non-asian faces. I don't understand why that's necessarily racist. On the other hand, no one thinks I'm sexist for only liking girls. 

Yes, all my relationships have been with asian girls, but they've been meaningful and with people I loved, and saying that I dated them ""just because they were asian"" is like saying I dated them ""just because they were girls"". I only date people I can be attracted to--but that's not exactly shocking behavior.

But there's SO MUCH stigma against white people exclusively dating asian girls.

N/A,"To the black community, with all sincerity and respect: I feel really uncomfortable discussing race with black people. I feel in constant danger of sincerely pissing you off or of my opinions being written off as invalid because I'm white. 

You guys have had to deal with immeasurable injustice and that understandably greatly affects the way you see and interact with the world. But I think the strong feelings you have about this should facilitate greater discussion not smother it. Black people, and other minorities, are exactly who I should be talking to to really understand and educate myself about racism. I think its vital that people not be afraid to. 

I'm not saying don't be angry. Be angry. But know that I'm angry too. Our justice system is fucked, and I'm not okay with living in a country that doesn't truly protect all of its citizens.

N/A,"I find it troublesome that there is all this attention to fighting sexual assault.  Too often I hear reports of two people, who are both drunk, hooking up and then the girl suddenly proclaims to be the victim even though both parties gave their consent (even if under the influence).  Then the case becomes her word against his word and in our society now there is a presumption of guilt with the man. For example the Duke lacrosse scandal a couple years ago ruined several young men's lives even though it was later found that they were completely innocent, as the ""victim"" simply lied.  I believe that if found guilty the perpetrators should be punished severely and swiftly, but in a country based on a presumption of innocence, I think the overreaction to sexual assault accusations goes against this foundational American value.",462508190484900_782183078517408,12,14,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,833

N/A,"Is anybody else really annoyed about how far just ""networking"" can get you? I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said ""thank you"" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.  

When I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like ""blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research"" or ""blah blah my teacher got me started in this"" or even ""blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in"" blah blah blah. Oh and also ""blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here."" Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords ""science"" and ""financial assistance."" I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges. 

I find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT. 

Now that I'm at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose—that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone.

N/A,"There's so much social pressure to be ""caring"" or ""empathetic"", but I don't understand it. Someone posted a while ago that they think their ""empathy is broken"", and I really feel the same - I knew Phoebe, but her death really, truly did not perturb me in the slightest. Sometimes I think that there's something wrong with me, and sometimes I think there's something wrong with the rest of the world, but I legitimately don't give a fuck about ""feelings"", ""honor"", ""empathy"" or other intangibles. 

This doesn't mean I'm continuously rude or selfish - I know how society works and conscious play the game to get ahead. But every expression, word, and action is a deliberate, calculated move to achieve a goal, never a relatable reaction. Usually this is exhilarating - liberating - I feel like I'm in absolute control of my life and most of the world around me - I feel like I can effect virtually anything I choose just by coordinating the right sequence of moves in the game.

But other times it's crushing, lonely, and bland, as if I've beaten the game but am still trapped in the same campaign, over and over and over again. Sometimes I'm ridiculously paranoid about people's motives, envisioning elaborate cons that they're manipulating, but in the end I'm only dreaming, *wishing* that they were because then I wouldn't be the only one.

Usually when I confide this to people, they'll smirk and nod, think I'm obsessed with Sherlock or Spock, and secretly lament that I've been so sheltered. When I do actually experience loss or [emotional stimulant], they say, I'll realize how foolish I am. Then they go back to their shallow little lives, splash around in their kiddie pool of friends and, if they're lucky or ambitious, make a few ripples of drama in society at large. Good for them.

Maybe someday, something horribly tragic (or terribly good) will happen to me and I'll snap out of it, discover empathy, and cannonball into the kiddie pool myself.

N/A,"So..the article ""Drunk female guests are the gravest threat to Fraternities"" has sparked a lot of conversation and anger.  And so has the response ""Fraternities are their own worst enemies, not Drunk Girls.""  

I'm going to be brutally honest.  I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about.  He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.  

Outside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules.  Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior.  I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic).  There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.  

I'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole).  I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party.  There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent.  And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy.  Politically that's just how it is.  

And let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation.  ""an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party.  I'm pretty sure the brothers, all the other frats, and the rest of campus took that more seriously than a party buzzkill.",462508190484900_756960334373016,4,34,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2094

N/A,"Maybe I am in the minority:I thought the Fossil Free MIT blue ribbon tape was a pretty neat and effective way to broadcast their message. It certainly caught my attention. It was big and bold and impossible to avoid. I thought it was wasteful at first. Sure, they could have done something else, but any complaining about the blue ribbon tape is, I feel, quite unjustified. The only reason I see people complaining is because they are an environmental group; I am sad to see that the same people are not complaining about the yellow ribbon MIT Facilities puts up on Kresge nearly every week, in an absolutely futile attempt to keep the grass green. It is akin to criticizing them for putting up copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other student group on campus. Are we to restrict this group, that is fighting to combat global climate change, to solely forms of communication that in no way affect the environment? If you have to use a few trees, or use a few gallons of gas, in order to save billions of trees and human life as we know it, by all means, you have my blessing.

Thank you, Fossil Free MIT. I am not a member, but your display brought a great issue to light. Everyone is talking about it, and even if they are discussing it negatively, at least they are talking about it. Plus, you got a response from President Reif! Go you! Please continue to encourage people to divest from fossil fuels, and make the world a better place. And if you have to use a few yards of blue ribbon tape once every year, by all means, do so: I think the cause you are fighting for is a little bit bigger than a roll of blue ribbon tape.

N/A,"Despite being an environmentalist, I really don't agree with Fossil Free MIT. In particular, their decision to put a blue rope around campus is quite hypocritical and counter productive. Fossil Free MIT seeks to divest MIT away from fossil fuel and promote sustainability yet their blue ropes did just the opposite. 
1) Those blue ropes are mostly made out of petroleum, specifically polypropylene, which uses fossil fuels to produce and transport. 
2) The the extensive use of the tape is wasteful use of resource. If this was a PR stunt, very few people had the time to stop to actually read the text on the tape - most people viewed it as a construction caution tape. People probably viewed it as a nuisance than informative as it was spread all over the place and made our campus look aesthetically displeasing.
3) The tape harms the environment. If Fossil Free MIT cared about sustainability, they should have realized that some of the tape they place came undone and flew away. Much like littering, those tape pieces now have the potential to get stuck around a bird's wing, chock a bird who accidentally swallows it, pollute the Charles River, etc. Considering that the tape was made from petroleum, it most likely will not biodegrade, leading to long term waste.

N/A,"To all the people complaining about white privilege:

Listen, white or not white, we all have struggles. And I know you feel hated on because everyone says you get special treatment and all minorities are oppressed because of it, and they're totally milking it and blah blah blah.
But just imagine--with all the hardships that EVERYONE has to go through, it would be nice for people of color to not get judged simply for being of color. To not be doubted on a daily basis about their intellectual ability because ""they're only here because of affirmative action."" It would be nice to not get looked at funny when you go to a store and are followed around by (usually white) employees because not being white apparently makes you a shoplifter. It'd be nice to walk down a street without people clutching their purses or children closer, or CROSSING THE FUCKING STREET because they're scared to pass you because you're not white so you MUST be a criminal. It would be nice to not have to worry about your parents being discriminated against and not realizing it because you're not there to understand when someone throws racial slurs at them and since they don't understand because English just happens to be a bitchy language to learn, all they can do is smile and greet them. Or to be worried that you're not there to translate your younger siblings' school papers to them so they don't always know what's going on. Is it really too much to ask to be treated fairly? I mean, look at what society is calling people of color. MINORITIES. They are automatically labeled as something INFERIOR. 
So please. If you're gonna go complaining because you're always seen as just another good citizen while people of color are constantly being accused of being criminals of the world for not having been born white, or because on top of all your other problems you AT LEAST have to deal with people seeing you as THE MINORITY--go do it with other privileged human beings and stop asking the people that are currently on the short end of the stick to feel sorry for you.

N/A,"white privilege, critical race theory and all the RACIST garbage like it, is meant to assign collective guilt and personal responsibility to all white people for the crime of being white in their own countries, cultures and societies. it becomes especially important a fiction when black racists have so little to actually point to.

it turns the reality of being a minority in a white society into instant victimization. this is racism that non-whites can enjoy, this is something created and scripted by WHITE LIBERALS first and foremost.

its no accident that the solution for ""white privilege"" just so happens to be white liberal ideology... its no accident that black racists are blind to their own indoctrination and servility.

affirmative action, entitlement programs and the like... the ONLY institutionalized racism that actually does exist, becomes the means in which black support is guaranteed. racism under the guise of ""social justice""

there is no Asian privilege in predominantly Asian countries.

there is no mestizo privilege in predominantly mestizo countries.

there is no black privilege in predominantly black countries.

anything, but ANYTHING you can attempt to describe as white privilege is seen and repeated in ALL non-white societies. but the very concept itself IS ONLY APPLIED to predominantly white countries, cultures and societies. being white makes you GUILTY. simply existing makes you GUILTY.

it is purely RACIST.

again.. it exists to ASSIGN COLLECTIVE GUILT on people who have harmed no one, who have committed no crime. it is used to justify collective responsibility on people simply for existing. its meant to provide JUSTIFICATION for racist policies and attitudes AGAINST THEM.

all of it, hinges on the idea that there is no such thing as white culture, communities, societies. that white people ""take for granted"" that they can walk out the door, go to work, the store, a club and expect to see people who like like themselves.

this is what white people ""take for granted"".... white people walk out the door and ""should"" expect to see black, asians, mestizos, arabs ...every race and creed. the very idea that white people expect to live in their own racial society, culture, and community makes them GUILTY of something.",462508190484900_637250616343989,14,1,0,0,0,0,0,?,?,?,?,mit_summer_confessions,2269

There was too much hate in their speech at times. The sad thing about politicians as I keep noticing from one country to another, is that they don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- I mean, that's not a bad thing, as long as you remind your community that there is a bigger picture as well, and that all humans are worthy of your love. We are all one. This whole world, the people everywhere are all good, kind people. Some are misled, instead of hating them and giving way to hate, why don't we start trying to fix them. Teaching them to love. Not hating them back and judging them and not giving them second chances.
It's not Boston ONE. It's humans ONE (humans in Boston in our case)- it was the love for people that made those brave Bostonians reach out and help during that catastrophe, it was not the fact that they had to help the Bostonians. Tell me, did those brave Boston men and women ask ""Oh, where are you from? So we know if we should help you or not?"". and it is sad that people at power don't understand it- or even worse, they don't care as long as it helps them politically. Saying things that do not inspire love or care for other people, they don't understand that the majority might just be carried away in those feeling of hate towards some other miserable person that for who-knows-what reasons has been brainwashed and misled into the hate and destruction. Our enemies are Hate and Destruction. Not people. I totally agree with both #440 and #437. And I'm glad looking at some many people think this way. I'm really glad.
