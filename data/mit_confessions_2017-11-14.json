Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Weinberg\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they\u2019re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIn contradistinction,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\u2019s for the ladies\u2019 eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
