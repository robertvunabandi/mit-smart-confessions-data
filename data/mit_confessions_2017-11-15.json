She'll get upset if I make plans to hang out with other people and when I invite her, she'll make my friends uncomfortable by acting surly and doesn't attempt to make conversation. She complains a lot about everything--her classes, the people around her, her friends and family back home, even small insignificant things! She always wants to be around me and it's mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with her all the time. I think she acts this way because she doesn't have many friends, but I don't want to be around her all the time with since it's really starting to have a negative impact on daily mood.
