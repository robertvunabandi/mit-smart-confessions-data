I sent up an Athena cluster printer to start printing, and then I went back to my computer because fuck standing at a printer waiting for 80 pages to print. After waiting for a bit, I went back to the printer to check on how it was doing, because it was probably close to being done anyways. What greets me is a stack of paper where every single sheet is completely black. I managed to single-handedly eviscerate an entire ink cartridge in one of the printers.\nOops.\nI think it was the weird format of the file that I downloaded that made the Athena printer shit itself.
