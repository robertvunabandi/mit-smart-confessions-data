Should people that are less unfortunate than you hate you just because you're more fortunate than them?

I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. \n\nI feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.\n\nThe alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma.
