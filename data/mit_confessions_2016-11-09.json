I was really torn this election, but I ended up voting for Trump. Though I don't agree with all of Hillary's policies or all of Trump's, I really did think about this decision hard, and I struggled with it. Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean I think he's anywhere close to a good person. Like many people who voted for Trump, I'm hesitant and worried about our country going forward. His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently. I am not trying to start an argument here, but I wish people who advocate for tolerance and justice would be able to respect that people who voted for Trump had their reasons. They have their values, and you shouldn't just assume yours are better than theirs.", "comments": 15, "reactions": {"like": 189, "love": 10, "haha": 1, "sorry": 1, "anger": 19}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 12347, "page_engaged_users": 4487, "page_views": 5424, "page_consumption": 17657}}, {"created_time": "2016-11-09T16:34:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1217407778328267", "message": "#8687 im sad and i just want to cuddle right now", "comments": 6, "reactions": {"like": 152, "love": 3, "wow": 1, "sorry": 15}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 12347, "page_engaged_users": 4487, "page_views": 5424, "page_consumption": 17657}}, {"created_time": "2016-11-09T16:33:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1217407488328296", "message": "#8684 On the bright side weed is legal now, so who is down for a giant blaze on killian?", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 72, "love": 7}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 12347, "page_engaged_users": 4487, "page_views": 5424, "page_consumption": 17657}}]
