I don\u2019t give a single fuck if you prefer vim or emacs or fucking eclipse. I haven\u2019t had a full night\u2019s sleep since before I graduated high school \u2014 fuck \u2014 and for what? This? So I can walk the streets of Cambridge, in the shadow of biotech companies and Google and Microsoft and all kinds of startup shit, suffocating while I\u2019m looking for a place to buy a $6 fucking cup of coffee? How\u2019s a kid supposed to live like this? I grew up loving outer space. I fancied myself an astrophysicist but I never wanted to touch another equation after 8.01. I came here so I could learn how to do anything I wanted, but I feel crippled and pigeonholed into a career where I\u2019ll be another cog in some corporate machine or some soon-to-fail \u201cfreethinking entrepreneur\u201d working at a startup until it is acquired by Facebook for a pittance. Don\u2019t even get me started about grad school. I don\u2019t think I could sit in another lecture if you held me at fucking gunpoint. I\u2019m the loser sitting through commencement, disgusted with myself, ignoring the speaker while all too appropriately surfing Facebook on my fucking iPhone \u2014 I\u2019m such a fucking sellout. I make noise and complain but do nothing. What a waste of space. I just want to sit by the river and read books the rest of my life while all you other kids sit waiting for your code to compile. I want to throw my computer and my brass rat into the Charles instead of turning this pset in. Do you think S^3 would write me a note for that? Sorry Mr. Asshole Professor, I couldn\u2019t do my fucking code review because I drowned my laptop mid-existential crisis; can I have an extra slack day? I\u2019ve laid to rest so many hopes and dreams here, and maybe that\u2019s just fucking growing up. Maybe that\u2019s just fucking life which isn\u2019t fair. Maybe I\u2019ll make mad cash working on an app for people to share memes or maybe I\u2019ll make some rich white dude richer by giving them a few nanoseconds more speed on their trading algorithms. Fuck me! And I swear to GOD if I get another email asking to unsubscribe. I hate the way that tourists clog the hallways, gawking at some lofty, imagined fiction we must all be living. But to live is to suffer and let me swear to you that I am suffering. I\u2019ve sold my soul for a piece of paper and the keys to the city, that is if the city was just some stand-up, networking cocktail hour with hors d'oeuvres that will end up on the free food mailing list which will be quickly claimed by some barefoot EC kid. I\u2019m tired of paragraph-long email signatures. I\u2019m tired of emails. I\u2019m tired of Slack notifications and friend requests. I\u2019m tired of taking pills in the morning and pills at night and pills during the day when it gets hard to breathe and stay upright. All I can think about is receptors and balancing chemical equations all the while wishing I could just be fucking normal. I hate fake friends and best friends who become family only to leave you all but dead in a ditch. To witness just how little we mean to each other is to witness poison seeping through the sidewalks of this city, and the poison absorbs into your body through the soles of your feet with each step you dare take inside city limits. To escape you go somewhere familiar and full of trees. A place where people have backyards and front yards and driveways. The space between houses, the space between your house and the nearest grocery store like a distance between celestial bodies. The clean air and open spaces are somehow suffocating. What is wrong with me? Hell, I\u2019d love to have a work-life balance if only I could think of something to fill my life with. Until then, it doesn\u2019t matter, put me to work with 16-hour days. Please, I beg you. Fill up the hours of the day with something. I just want to be financially stable; I just want to find some contentment with being. I just want to sleep without dreaming.", "comments": 60, "reactions": {"like": 253, "love": 32, "wow": 8, "haha": 8, "sorry": 107}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 24543, "page_engaged_users": 18, "page_views": 96, "page_consumption": 20}}]
