So what if two really drunk people have sex? They raped each other seems like a dumb answer. If neither of them are responsible, it seems I should get super drunk as a safe guard but that also seems dumb.

Classes are hard and extracurricular are stressful. I love my friends and enjoy spending time with them, but sometimes wonder how close we really are and if they really like me, or if we\u2019re just pset buddies or friends on the surface. I feel like I know a decent number of people, but don\u2019t know how many I\u2019m really that close with. It\u2019s sad to me that I\u2019m having a hard time finding groups to hang out or go to events with, and feel slightly left out a lot.
