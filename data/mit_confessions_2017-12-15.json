His notes on my PSets would make me smile, especially when he'd put a little smiley face at the end. Giving us sugar and therefore energy from day 1 with those Starbursts, but last last recitation going on about how sugar lobbiests basically brainwashed the country into thinking it was fat that was bad for you (when it was really the sugar.) To this TA, I'd like to tell you that I definitely didn't talk as much in class as I could have, but I legitimately enjoyed recitation so much because you were my TA.
