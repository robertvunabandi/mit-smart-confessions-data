I can't tell you how many times I've gotten full credit on a pset or exam problem I'm stuck on or don't have time to finish by just writing an obvious statement that is semi-related to the problem and technically true, but doesn't actually answer the question at all. My favorite is when the question asks you to prove or say why something is true and I just write that it is true because it is true and get full credit.",
