    "message": "#13961 I'm finally tired of this stupid fucking culture at MIT. The culture I'm talking about is the one where everyone tries their best to skirt direct language when they know it's going to hurt someone's feelings. It's so fucking tiring and difficult to have to think about how I can tell you that your contribution to this group project is fucking garbage and that everything you've done is completely pointless without hurting your feelings. And this is only one symptom of the culture. Tiptoeing around these issues in person is the reason Timely confessions was so toxic; because noone was willing to own up to their own opinions for fear of being disagreed with. It's disgusting. If anyone who knows me sees this, they will know I was the one who posted this because from now on when you're being a fucking idiot I'm going to let you know.",
