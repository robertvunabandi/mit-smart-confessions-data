    "message": "#8369 I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don\u2019t. \n\nPeople don\u2019t seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven\u2019t made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It\u2019s my fault I\u2019m so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I\u2019m just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I\u2019ve only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they\u2019re handling it better than me. I\u2019m probably just weak.\n\nI know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because \"you can't get through MIT alone,\" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.\n\nI already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can\u2019t they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it\u2019s their job to make sure that I\u2019m not in any \u201cimmediate danger,\u201d but at the same time, couldn\u2019t they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn\u2019t even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they \u201ccared.\u201d They don\u2019t really care; It\u2019s just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.\n\nNow I\u2019m more depressed than ever. It\u2019s so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What\u2019s the point anymore? I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t ask MIT Mental Health help because they\u2019ll just send me to a mental hospital. I can\u2019t talk to friends because they honestly don\u2019t care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can\u2019t tell my family because I don\u2019t want them to worry. I\u2019m not doing well with any of my psets, tests, or obligations because I can\u2019t concentrate. But at this rate, it\u2019s so hard to just keep living through every single day with a fake mask of happiness. When is it all going to be over...",

I honestly answered, \u2018No, this is my first time.\u2019\n\nSo she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.\n\n\u2018Just a minute,\u2019 she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. \u2018Do these excite you?\u2019 She asked.\n\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n\u2018Well, come on\u2019, she said, \u2018We don\u2019t have much time.\u2019 So I climbed on her.

Though I don't agree with all of Hillary's policies or all of Trump's, I really did think about this decision hard, and I struggled with it. Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean I think he's anywhere close to a good person. Like many people who voted for Trump, I'm hesitant and worried about our country going forward. His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently. I am not trying to start an argument here, but I wish people who advocate for tolerance and justice would be able to respect that people who voted for Trump had their reasons. They have their values, and you shouldn't just assume yours are better than theirs.",

I think everyone's experience here differs, and I know of quite a few people who feel as though they've gotten opportunities here that they couldn't get anywhere else. I certainly feel like I've had some of those opportunities, but I feel as though there's not really that much positive reinforcement at this school. Throughout my time here, I've simply encountered feedback on how inadequate I was, no matter how hard I try sometimes. I guess it's good to know what my shortcomings are so that I can do better next time, but at the same time, I've never felt so dispassionate about my work as I do now. I've always known that there are lots of things I can improve, but I've rarely had an environment in which essentially everything that I tried to do turned out to be a failure. It's nice to sometimes catch a break.",

I miss cuddling together. I miss so many things. I just wish this would go away. I thought I was getting better, but today I think I had a relapse. I still feel really hurt. Some of the things that happened between us were so painful and at times I was very unhappy with how things were between us. So I guess it was probably for the better.

    "message": "#9191 When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",

I just feel like the material moves so fast in all of my classes that I have to half ass a lot of my psets. I don't have time to study, and once I get a few days behind, I have to give up on deep understanding to just get through the semester. I know I'm a reasonably smart person. If given adequate time to learn the material (which is assumed review for many), I'd do fine. It almost makes me wish I would have gone to an easier school, so I could have learned more. I haven't seriously thought about transferring becuase the people here are so great. Has anyone experienced something similar?",

I've always prided myself on being there for my friends though, and as someone who also struggles with mental health, I really want to be there for my friends who struggle with theirs. But I'm realizing it's just not sustainable or practical. I'm only taking 4 classes and I've become minimally involved in extracurriculars, yet I still feel like I constantly have to work and study to get the grades I want. I'm becoming like the people here who prioritize school over friends, people I always used to resent and complain about. Makes me feel hypocritical. IHTFP.

    "message": "#9801 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Weinberg\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they\u2019re not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIn contradistinction,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\u2019s for the ladies\u2019 eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e",

She complains a lot about everything--her classes, the people around her, her friends and family back home, even small insignificant things! She always wants to be around me and it's mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with her all the time. I think she acts this way because she doesn't have many friends, but I don't want to be around her all the time with since it's really starting to have a negative impact on daily mood.

I cheer on these people all the time but never have anyone do the same for me even once.

I guess people don't bother with me because I cheer on others so much that they think I cheer on myself?

I literally spend every waking moment of the day studying and working and still just barely getting by. All I want is to not just feel like my only purpose in life is to be someone else's expendable mascot.",

I hope everyone, including the BSU, realize that asking any handful of black people how they feel about a topic is not inherently representative of the opinions of black people as a whole, and that it is important to try to convey the diversity of black opinion (e.g. many blacks are fine with the idea of non-blacks wearing dreads)",

That's not to say that you might not be a good match, but stop projecting your idealized traits onto her and making her out to be some perfect person in your mind because the fact is she isn't. You putting her on a pedestal is only going to fuck up any chances you have because you're going to be clingy and needy and seeking validation from her, and idk her so I can't say whether or not she will like the attention at first but she definitely will not truly care for it in the long run. Realize that she's just another human being, and talk to her. Find out who she really is, and if you love that person then go for it, but realize that the girl in your head is not the girl that exists in real life.",

    "message": "#10267 I am genuinely puzzled why the academics at MIT is expected (by students/their parents) to be filtered in such a way that nobody gets offended/hurt. I recently came across a confession where, the OP was considering reporting a HASS class after they had to watch a disturbing movie for it. (It may be appropriate for them to personally skip that particular homework, but I do not believe that the professor is at fault for assigning that movie.)\nOn a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT,  especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.\nI understand that certain things are taboo, sometimes only in specific cultures, and MIT needs maintain their diversity by making everyone feel welcomed. However, censoring out these things would be like avoiding to face reality and, in an academic setting, this may impair the progress that can potentially be made. Thoughts?\n(It would be ironic if my confession got filtered out for bringing this up :/.)",

I sent up an Athena cluster printer to start printing, and then I went back to my computer because fuck standing at a printer waiting for 80 pages to print. After waiting for a bit, I went back to the printer to check on how it was doing, because it was probably close to being done anyways. What greets me is a stack of paper where every single sheet is completely black. I managed to single-handedly eviscerate an entire ink cartridge in one of the printers.\nOops.\nI think it was the weird format of the file that I downloaded that made the Athena printer shit itself. But now you guys know - if you think you've used the most ink out of any student at MIT, you're not even close.",

I loved how my TA would get excited about \"really cool stuff\" like trees and how he'd go off into tangents about research \"that happened really recently actually.\" I even liked that fact that he explained how viruses survive by saying how \"shitty\" they are at checking for mutations. His notes on my PSets would make me smile, especially when he'd put a little smiley face at the end. Giving us sugar and therefore energy from day 1 with those Starbursts, but last last recitation going on about how sugar lobbiests basically brainwashed the country into thinking it was fat that was bad for you (when it was really the sugar.) To this TA, I'd like to tell you that I definitely didn't talk as much in class as I could have, but I legitimately enjoyed recitation so much because you were my TA. Thank you so much for making this an awesome first semester at MIT and tbh, I still have that tiny crush on you.",

Of course I appreciate their kind words, but that\u2019s not the way things are supposed to be. \n\nMIT spend all this effort focusing on research and ignoring teaching quality. I only fell in love with the subject I am TAing because I had an amazing professor. The fact that the school kills students\u2019 interest in subjects with bad professors is depressing. One of the saddest things in life is wasted talent.",

I don't know where you get that spirit, energy and love for life. I enjoy how you bring laughter and great conversation to the table. As difficult as it is to write, only because I care for you, as a friend I suggest you focus on the serious candidates and stop spreading yourself thinly amongst the amount of guy friends that you have. I guarantee you these lucky guys who have an opportunity to call you theirs have mixed emotions with your actions towards all your other friends. Guys are guys, they like to talk and would not like for your rep to be attacked. I know you are not about that one bit, and you deserve to be respected, which I would totally do if you had me, but as a friend I would like for you to be more cautious. Trust me, the guy friends you have now will continue  to be your friends because you're you. I for one are one of those friends. Maybe someday you will see me in the same way I see you. If your perspective crushes don't see what a diamond you are, they are absolute tomfools. I for sure see the radiant light that you emit. Only a few days left before you leave and it sucks you won't be around for six weeks, but I can't wait to hear about your travels to San Diego and Israel. I'll anxiously be awaiting your return.",

They coach is really rooting for me so I kinda feel like I'd be letting them down if I don't at least try to get in, but I also can't even bring myself to even write a good \"why this school\" essay.

I see my vote for neither of them as a screw you to the system (obviously who I voted for wasn't going to win, it wasn't about that). It's about time we stop only having two choices, and that's never going to happen if people just continue to choose the lesser of two evils. And before you make the old argument \"\"if you didn't vote for Hillary you don't care about minorities\"\", know that I am a proud queer woman of color. \n\n(@admins I'd really like this posted so if you need to take out the first sentence to do that go ahead :/ but please don't if you don't have to....don't post this request part tho)",

    "message": "#10887 As a person from a lower socioeconomic class, I feel intensely compelled to get everything I can out of my college experience. I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. \n\nI feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.\n\nThe alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma. Anyone have tips?",

    "message": "#10956 tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life\n\nI wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.\nBut I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.\nBecause the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.\n\nMIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.",

When I ask you, my best friend, out on a date, it's not another person you sorta know asking you out: you don't understand how much I have agonized on the inside, consulted with friends, driven myself to madness, and repeated all the reasons to myself why I should back down and not risk this friendship. To say I have thought long and hard about whether to ask you out is an understatement. So I'm sorry that if after a couple of dates when you say you don't want to continue I am far more emotionally devastated than you could ever understand. And you may think you're helping by giving me space and retreating out of my life, but if you're going to do that, at least say that you are instead of leaving me wondering what I did wrong and confirming the biggest fear about asking you out: that I would lose my best friend. You don't understand the pain I go through every time you say you're not free to hang out, every time you don't want to sit next to me in class, and every time it's made obvious that I care about reestablishing our best friendship way more than you do. I'm over you romantically, but I'm not over losing my best friend. Please do something to show me that you still care",

After working for a year at a cushy Course 6-related job and coming home for the holidays, I decided to catch up with some of my old high school friends that I used to be really close to. We still crack the same old jokes at each other and have a good time overall, but I find myself wanting to avoid talking about my new comfortable lifestyle, as many of them have struggled to find a job that they enjoy or relates to their major or doesn't exhaust them. I understand that this is the reality for most people and I appreciate the opportunities I've been given in this lifetime so far, but it hurts to see my old friends struggling to get by with jobs that they hate and/or wear them out mainly because of the different opportunities that were presented to us at the relatively young age of 17-18.",

They're majoring in astrophysics, engineering, etc. One of my friends reads multiple books in a day and another has learning disabilities but is majoring in nursing with straight A's. We seem to think we're better than those who go to state schools and community colleges because we're at MIT or whatever private university in the surrounding area.

It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. \n\nSo yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of. I need to harden, because people will expect a junior to coddle, not be coddled. I will never have this magical transition so many people have here, and it eats away at me because I missed this fun development process they got through no effort of their own.",

I feel like I'm in a similar situation (financially, family used to be doing not so great; parents made a lot of sacrifices and never really did anything for themselves in order to get my siblings and I the best education possible throughout our lives; money used to be hella tight;etc. But now, they're doing much better, and we live comfortably, though still without luxuries like trips or a new car and such), but I get excellent aid (tuition covered, and I cover my expenses + housing with work during the semester + my savings). All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out. Yet, there's been a lot of confessions/comments recently pointing to A LOT of major flaws in the system, and individual cases that were clearly poorly handled by finaid, such as yours.\n\nI'm really curious if there's any sort of complete data/survey information out there that would give a better sense of where these flaws in the system are coming from, and how they could be addressed. Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers. It just seems like looking at the data and figuring out exactly where the problem is will provide the best jumping off point for then starting to go to MIT and ask for change.",

I've fucked sixteen freshmen and fourteen non-frosh. In general, I've had good experiences with most of the girls. The top five girls I've fucked have come from \u03a3\u039a, \u039a\u0391\u0398, \u0391\u03a6, \u03a7\u039b\u039c and \u0394\u03a3\u0398. The most disappointing girls have been from \u0391\u039a\u0391, \u0391\u03a7\u039f and \u0391\u0395\u03a6. I've fucked only three girls multiple times coz they were so good. The most athletic girl was from \u039a\u0391\u0398 whilst the kinkiest was from \u03a3\u039a. I look forward to completing my quest, this IAP.",

Cause yeah Spanish/Portuguese is Iberian and Iberian is white. A lot of Spanish have Arab, and Arab is also white soooo. You have motherfuckers in Cuba and Argentina that are like 100% European, and then you have the real og \"Brown People\" who are not even on social media because they're still stuck in places like Oaxaca or Arequipa. Even when talking about the whities, socioeconomic status is important cause a white guy from a ranch in Nuevo Leon != white guy from Polanco, Mexico City.

    "message": "#11774 Ok question. If I tend to find taller men more physically attractive, does this make me racist against any race whose genetic composition makes members of that race, on average, shorter? For clarity, assume I don't have a \"height cutoff\" and can be attracted to shorter men for many other reasons, but height is generally a factor in my physical attraction.\n\nAlso, if I think brown eyes are very beautiful, more so than blue/green/etc eyes, am I being racist against any race whose genetic composition results in predominantly blue eyes?\n\nAt what point do I have the right to be attracted to one person over another without being racist? Why can't I be attracted to certain features more than others, if my attractions are based on those features and not on my knowledge of someone's race? And, since perhaps the genetic makeup of one race results in many people with many of the features I like, why can't I say that I'm more likely to be attracted to a member of that race? Remember, nowhere here have I said that this is a checklist. It's not that I'd *only* be attracted to people of that race. It's simply more likely because statistically there are more people with the features that attract me.",

I think about that moment sometimes and think wow, we are so in love right now. What a fuggin comeback. Here's the lesson folks, if the patriots can come back from a 3-28 game in the superbowl, and I can come back from accidentally telling my new SO 'I love you', then we all can come back from anything life throws at us, whether it be a bad grade or a fight with someone you care about or a rejection from your dream job, you can come back from it. We can all come back from anything, just reach out, take care of yourself, and believe. Goodbye, I love you all",

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical campus \"\"hacking\"\" culture most of the jokes will go over a typical student's head. There's also the movement's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - Mass Tech's personal philosophy draws heavily from dormspam flame wars, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Mass Tech truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mass Tech's existencial catchphrase \"\"We Are Mass Tech,\"\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Mass Tech banner unfolds itself over Lobby 7. What fools... how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Mass Tech t-shirt. And no, you cannot see it.

    "message": "#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.\n\nI feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: \n\n1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  \n\n2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to \"do well\" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. \n\nMIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  \n\nBasically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",

I've done fine at school and enjoy what I'm doing now. Family is loving and supportive. My living situation is good and I've also traveled to two dozen countries and lived in four.\n\nDespite all of that, I am deeply unhappy.\n\nIt comes down to a few things:\n[1] Uncertainty about the future/career\n[2] Struggling with being an introvert in an extroverted society\n[3] Inability to find a life partner despite numerous sincere efforts\n[4] Always investing in other people's well-being and putting myself second while getting very little in return (closely related to [3] )\n\nWhile I can identify causes, I cannot get myself out. The anxiety is taking a heavy toll on my life and potential and making me into a shell of who I was 10 years ago. There's no way around it: I need therapy.\n\nAnd thus I have learned that mental health is key. Mental health is everything.",

I hate it when they put white people in black roles and vice versa; when you change the race of the actor or the character, you're just saying that the race's identity has no value. Black Panther was an amazing example of how great a story is when you have black actors in black roles. e.g. I'm not saying that we can't have a black James Bond, but just don't call him James Bond. Give him his own back story that celebrates his own identity. He deserves it.",

We have unmatched endurance among mammals, and even though your typical antelope could easily out-sprint a human, our ancestors would chase it down over tens of miles until it collapsed of exhaustion.  Over long distances, a fit human can outrun a horse.  Modern agriculture has largely eliminated persistence hunting outside of a few isolated communities, but every once in a while, that powerful, tenacious tendency rises to the surface in unexpected ways.  This one sophomore, for example, has been hitting on me with such a relentless and powerful intensity that I'm afraid my crufty legs can't outrun her much longer.",

But now I feel like I finished broadening out and I have no idea what I should be focusing on anymore. Classes just seem like a waste if I can't fold it into a master plan for at least some kind of short term goal. How do people settle on particular passions in life when you've never had a significant life event point you in some direction? I feel like I could pretty much choose anything I want to pursue and be able to succeed, but I can't decide which thing to do. I would normally try to prioritize things I am currently interested and then as I tackle the list, try to pivot as I better learn what I'm interested in, but everything on the list is so close in priority that it seems too arbitrary. Why does person X wanna be a doctor so bad, person Y want to work on AI research, and person Z want to build rocket ships and knew this preference for the last 5 years?\n\nPlz post thoughts and links to things that help answer all this",

You are paying for your time and for other people to do the shopping, prepare your food, and clean up after you (question: does would this make food cost more money?). OF COURSE IT IS MORE MONEY THAN DOING IT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOUR TIME COSTS MONEY youse goddamn idiots. You are paying for the convenience of focusing on your classes. Also, unless you only eat just a sandwich around here, chances are you are spending close to $13 per meal dinning out in Cambridge (unless maybe you are a vegetarian but still).",

The US isn't a Christian nation, so it shouldn't be making rules like one.\n2. Why do people oppose stricter gun laws? A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.\n3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.\n4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US? And why are Asians do complacent in all of this? Asians literally get no benefit from anything race-related in the US: if being a minority is an \"\"advantage,\"\" then Asians don't count (education), yet when being a minority is a disadvantage (otherhood and being targets of racial violence), Asians suddenly become minorities again... CAN YOU PEOPLE MAKE UP YOUR MIND!?!",

I think that, for the most part, it would make sense for a person currently undergoing a sexual transition to eventually disclose to the other party (who may or may not be accepting of a gender transition) that they are in fact transgender. \n\nIf in the near future we were able to undergo gender reassignment surgery so perfect that one wouldn't be able to tell a female born at birth vs. male born at birth -> transitioned into a female, then would it/should it be something to be disclosed to others?",

    "message": "#13627 I'm tired of all these \"I shouldn't have been hospitalized, they had no right to do this, don't seek help because you'll be sent to a mental hospital, etc\". First of all, if you're sent to the hospital it's because a professional believes that you cannot keep yourself safe and whether you expressed that to them or not, professionals are trained to recognize when the situation is getting out of hand. Nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but I also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. Spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. Often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. It's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.",

I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement\u2014 please don\u2019t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\n\nAnyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\n\nIf this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\n\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left? Please don\u2019t hate on me :(",

    "message": "#13794 I\u2019m so fucking tired of talk about linear algebra, proprietary software, and all these news articles about Trump\u2019s latest faux pas. I don\u2019t give a single fuck if you prefer vim or emacs or fucking eclipse. I haven\u2019t had a full night\u2019s sleep since before I graduated high school \u2014 fuck \u2014 and for what? This? So I can walk the streets of Cambridge, in the shadow of biotech companies and Google and Microsoft and all kinds of startup shit, suffocating while I\u2019m looking for a place to buy a $6 fucking cup of coffee? How\u2019s a kid supposed to live like this? I grew up loving outer space. I fancied myself an astrophysicist but I never wanted to touch another equation after 8.01. I came here so I could learn how to do anything I wanted, but I feel crippled and pigeonholed into a career where I\u2019ll be another cog in some corporate machine or some soon-to-fail \u201cfreethinking entrepreneur\u201d working at a startup until it is acquired by Facebook for a pittance. Don\u2019t even get me started about grad school. I don\u2019t think I could sit in another lecture if you held me at fucking gunpoint. I\u2019m the loser sitting through commencement, disgusted with myself, ignoring the speaker while all too appropriately surfing Facebook on my fucking iPhone \u2014 I\u2019m such a fucking sellout. I make noise and complain but do nothing. What a waste of space. I just want to sit by the river and read books the rest of my life while all you other kids sit waiting for your code to compile. I want to throw my computer and my brass rat into the Charles instead of turning this pset in. Do you think S^3 would write me a note for that? Sorry Mr. Asshole Professor, I couldn\u2019t do my fucking code review because I drowned my laptop mid-existential crisis; can I have an extra slack day? I\u2019ve laid to rest so many hopes and dreams here, and maybe that\u2019s just fucking growing up. Maybe that\u2019s just fucking life which isn\u2019t fair. Maybe I\u2019ll make mad cash working on an app for people to share memes or maybe I\u2019ll make some rich white dude richer by giving them a few nanoseconds more speed on their trading algorithms. Fuck me! And I swear to GOD if I get another email asking to unsubscribe. I hate the way that tourists clog the hallways, gawking at some lofty, imagined fiction we must all be living. But to live is to suffer and let me swear to you that I am suffering. I\u2019ve sold my soul for a piece of paper and the keys to the city, that is if the city was just some stand-up, networking cocktail hour with hors d'oeuvres that will end up on the free food mailing list which will be quickly claimed by some barefoot EC kid. I\u2019m tired of paragraph-long email signatures. I\u2019m tired of emails. I\u2019m tired of Slack notifications and friend requests. I\u2019m tired of taking pills in the morning and pills at night and pills during the day when it gets hard to breathe and stay upright. All I can think about is receptors and balancing chemical equations all the while wishing I could just be fucking normal. I hate fake friends and best friends who become family only to leave you all but dead in a ditch. To witness just how little we mean to each other is to witness poison seeping through the sidewalks of this city, and the poison absorbs into your body through the soles of your feet with each step you dare take inside city limits. To escape you go somewhere familiar and full of trees. A place where people have backyards and front yards and driveways. The space between houses, the space between your house and the nearest grocery store like a distance between celestial bodies. The clean air and open spaces are somehow suffocating. What is wrong with me? Hell, I\u2019d love to have a work-life balance if only I could think of something to fill my life with. Until then, it doesn\u2019t matter, put me to work with 16-hour days. Please, I beg you. Fill up the hours of the day with something. I just want to be financially stable; I just want to find some contentment with being. I just want to sleep without dreaming.",

It is never your fault, but you need to protect yourselves at these parties.

This grave mistake must be addressed for the dual connotation of noobishness and disrespect.\n\nI am demanding that in the future all correspondence refrain from this weak terminology in favor of alternative synonyms. Acceptable words include: exciting, enjoyable, or illuminating.\n\nI don't mean to hurt anyone feelings by this, but the greatest authors of English literature did not toil and suffer for the likes of their entomological descendants to barrage the classic language with half baked substitutes for meaningful communication. Shakespeare suffered through a heinous divorce and multiple dead children understanding that his legacy would live on through the power of his invaluable contributions to western culture. Charles Dickens\u2018s father did not beat him and banish him from school so that his literature could be debased by the likes of immature school children not wanting to put forth the effort of a real sentence. Mary Shelley was not blackmailed by her enemies only to be betrayed and back-stabbed by the very individuals she devoted her life to serve.\n\nSo please, l ask of you, remember the great founders of our great culture and language in the future, when you feel so compelled to utilize such base incantations with less meaning than the sum of their letters. Indeed, instead of disgracing our ancestors without even the respect of doing it to their faces, honor them by elevating yourself to the higher standard of distinguished language.\n\nThank you",

The culture I'm talking about is the one where everyone tries their best to skirt direct language when they know it's going to hurt someone's feelings. It's so fucking tiring and difficult to have to think about how I can tell you that your contribution to this group project is fucking garbage and that everything you've done is completely pointless without hurting your feelings. And this is only one symptom of the culture. Tiptoeing around these issues in person is the reason Timely confessions was so toxic; because noone was willing to own up to their own opinions for fear of being disagreed with. It's disgusting. If anyone who knows me sees this, they will know I was the one who posted this because from now on when you're being a fucking idiot I'm going to let you know.",

Product rule remains my specialty.\nI ask Professor Seidel his thoughts on quantum mechanics and partial derivatives. He's impressed i know about the subject. We converse after class for some time, sharing mathematical insights; i can keep up. He tells me of great things ahead like series and laplacians. I tell him i already read about series on wikipedia. He is yet again impressed at my enthusiasm. What a joy it is to have your professor visibly brighten when he learns of your talents.\nAnd now I sit here wondering what it must be like to be a brainlet, unable to engage your professor as an intellectual peer. All of the deep conversations you people must miss out on because you aren't able to overcome the intellectual IQ barrier that stands in the way of your academic success... it's so sad. Paul and I know each other on first name basis now, but i call him Dr. out of respect.\nAnd yet here you brainlets sit, probably havent even made eye contact with yours out of fear that they will gauge your brainlet IQ levels.\nA true shame, but just know it is because i was born special that i am special. I can't help being a genius, nor can my professor. Two of a kind is two flocks in a bush.",

I worked my ass off to get here and I STILL am because I know that a person with my background doesn't get to just stay at MIT status without constantly proving themself. But of course the daughter of college professors who grew up in wonderful white suburbia moves to a super liberal state college and starts going on about how \"private school kids\" have SO much privilege and that everything I do is \"the most privileged thing\" they've ever heard. Like hmmm you ever think to realize that maybe I do what I do because I know what it's like to not have anything? Just because I'm a functional adult and not shy about asking for things doesn't mean I'm some sort of privileged sheltered college student.

The only class I got a B in was a hard HASS class that I really just took because I felt I needed to know a bit more about the subject, like for life, not academics. I took that class as Sophomore Exploratory, so I can drop the grade, and if I do I would get a 5.0. For most things, I know the difference between a 4.8 and a 5.0 is negligible, especially because my only B is a hass class unrelated to anything I'm interested in doing later in life. If there is no advantage to having a 5.0 other than being able to boast of a pure record, I would rather take the hass credit, but if there is any advantage to a 5.0 I'm fine with taking another hass later. Does anybody know if there are any such advantages?",

    "message": "#13703 I'm attracted to my own sex (male, if anyone was wondering). I've known this for a while now, about seven years. I've never really known what to do about it other than hide it. In middle and high school, I feared I'd be alienated, abandoned, persecuted, or harassed. Now I'm done my first year of college and I still don't know what to do.\nLife at home can be summed up in one word: \"Christian.\" Whatever preconceived notions you may have of the faith, or of faith in general, I want to try to get across my personal experience with it and how it affects me. My siblings and I did the whole \"church\" thing growing up: weekly Sunday school, church with family, prayers before every meal, and the Lord's Prayer before bedtime. We all even went/are going to Christian private schools from Pre-K to 12.\nFor some reason, I took it upon myself to be the best Christian I could possibly be: memorizing Scripture, reciting the Ten Commandments and Fruit of the Spirit as if they were the Pledge of Allegiance, and keeping close to my heart each lesson and sermon I was taught. I don't know why it was so important to me. Looking back, it probably had less to do with my own faith and growth as a person and more to do with being the most respected child when surrounded by adults.\nThis happened until I was around twelve during middle school. I won't go into the details of my sexual awakening. The important part is that I felt trapped. I didn't think my parents or friends would understand. I certainly didn't want to confide in my teachers or church leaders, so I felt alone. \nAs a result I spent a lot of sermons over the next few years thinking about myself and what it really meant to be a Christian. Every now and then there would be a sermon about how members of the congregation should interact with homosexuals and what the Bible says about homosexuality. But I soon learned that different pastors will often derive different conclusions to the same issue; thus, I felt even more alone. Honestly, I still don't know my own place in the faith.\nEven with the friends I made, I felt like an imposter. My core group of friends, who I love to death, do not know about me. Before my senior year, I didn't think anyone would stand by me if I came out. I thought people would see me as filthy or sinful or something like that. But when I finally got it through my thick skull that they really have my back, I felt ashamed for thinking otherwise. I felt like I betrayed them somehow, that the person they've been laughing with for years is really a mannequin made for show. I don't know what telling them could do to each of our individual friendships, so I'm still doing what I've always done: hiding. It's selfish of me, I know. Maybe I'm just a coward.\nOne of those friends taught me just how devastating a crush could be. I don't even remember when it happened, but one day I just started seeing him as a romantic interest. Pushing back my feelings, I determined that all I'd ever be was a good friend, so I did that. I helped him with family issues, his own romance woes, academic trouble, all the while secretly pining for him. The story doesn't end well, as you probably already know. At the start of junior year, I determined that it was unhealthy for me to be around him all the time, so I distanced myself from him to try and get over my now three-year-long crush. Less than a month later, he got himself expelled and was disowned by his parents not too long after. Since then, I've seen him a handful of times, and each time I feel guilty. I feel guilty for not being a better friend and for having feelings that I felt I shouldn't have had in the first place.\nEver since then I've felt lost, like I'm searching for a new goal to aspire to or a place to call a home. I haven't found it. In my house, I just find my own corner and hope to be left alone. At church, I sit and just count the moments until service is over. And when I'm hanging out with friends, I feel like a cardboard version of myself.\nAnd that brings me here to MIT. Now I'm in college, my first year down and I'm still hiding. I know people who state their identities proudly, and I envy them greatly. I wish that, for a moment, I could be like them. That I could be brave enough tell the world who I am without being afraid of any repercussions. That I could have enough self-certainty to tell everyone what I believe in and why. That I could walk confidently enough to not second guess my own decisions in life. \nBut I'm not like those people. I'm not like most of you. I have no voice. I have no self-assurance. I have no presence. I guess I've gotten good at hiding.",

Eat-guilt/fear-coping-eat-guilt/fear-coping, repeats. I hope people at MIT can be more educated about eating disorder and understand how much it impacts a person's self-esteem, body health, anxiety... It's very difficult for eating disorder patients to tell others about our feelings, we dont even know why we do this to ourselves. Be a good person, a good friend, dont blame your friends and ask them why they do that to themselves, instead, give them understanding and go fucking educate yourself on eating disorders.",

    "message": "#13667 As a moderate conservative, it's been difficult for me to understand one part of the transgender movement. I'm posting on here because I'm looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement\u2014 please don't hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don't mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\n\nAnyways, on with the question. I'm confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don't necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \"female\" activities such as putting on make up, liking \"girlish\" colors, and \"speaking\" like a girl? I guess what I'm asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\n\nIf this is the case, then why can't we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \"him\" a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \"transgender (in this sense)?\" Isn't that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\n\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \"gender,\" even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn't exist according to the left? Please don't hate on me :(",

Furthermore, they seem very eager to claim the discrimination that they experience (like with admissions rates), but will ignore racism that effects the underrepresented minorities.  Please remember that even though you are minorities, you can still be symptomatic of racist ideals and please listen (and believe) to your fellow people of color when they talk about their experiences.",

First of all, if you're sent to the hospital it's because a professional believes that you cannot keep yourself safe and whether you expressed that to them or not, professionals are trained to recognize when the situation is getting out of hand. Nobody likes going to the mental hospital; my experience was also stressful but I also didn't kill myself and that's the whole point. Spending a few days in the hospital where you can just forget about everything else and be taken care of, even if it is scary and not great or you don't want to be there, it's worth it if you come out ok. Often, it's difficult for people to have an objective understanding of how bad the situation is. It's like waiting so long before asking for help that first time because you've convinced yourself that you're ok for so long - it takes a while to get through your anger and frustration before you can come to terms with the fact that maybe you did need to be there and that professionals don't send patients away willy nilly.",

    "message": "#13618 I feel like a lot of people who have been involuntarily hospitalized while at MIT may have just not known the right things to say. If you're talking about suicidal thoughts, they need to actually have reasonable suspicion that you are willing and able to go through with it before they can commit you. One way to discuss this is along the lines of \"\"Sometimes I have suicidal ideation which is really painful and awful and I want help for it... BUT of course I would never ever actually do it, I wouldn't want to hurt my family like that, and I've never really considered how I would practically do it!!!\"\" Or, for psychosis, \"\"I often have visual and auditory hallucinations... BUT I know they're not real, they haven't gotten any worse lately, and since I know they're fake I would never listen to anything they say!!!\"\" (Also, never never never crack jokes about suicide or self-harm around your therapist/doctor. I know that statements like \"\"haha I wanna die\"\" are a common form of humor, and that joking can relive tension, and you may be really used to it, but you still absolutely should not do it.)\n\nI know it's shitty that you have to attenuate all your statements like that in order to get help. But as long as you make it very very very explicit that you are not a danger to yourself or others, you reduce your risk of involuntary hospitalization vastly.",

From having to settle. From having to take on a nagging maternal caretaker role. From feeling unequal. From having a basic ass relationship. I really felt that, I believed it, I saw it.",

    "message": "#13575 I've been debating on and off about going to MIT Mental Health during my walk-in hours but I'm afraid to. Everytime I climb up the stairs to the 3rd floor, I just immediately bail after seeing the receptionist at the front desk. I have had friends who have had horrible experience with MIT Mental, and I also just don't want to admit that there might be something wrong with me that isn't as fixable. I used to be normal, but there are more and more days where I just wake up and feel burned out and I can't get up out of bed. I've talked to my mom about this, but she just tells me to go exercise and sleep more and that mental health issues aren't real. It doesn't help that my parents think that I'm being a huge mistake and will be a failure if I don't eventually become a doctor or a businesswoman. My mom's already planning things out for my kids, and I just feel like I'm already being relegated (Like I don't know if I even want children why are you trying to impose your vision of a perfect life on me). Honestly I want to take a gap year but I'm just afraid to tarnish the image of the perfect daughter they've pinned all their hopes and dreams on, and then they won't love me anymore. I'm also afraid of losing my friends since we're all going our separate ways after graduation, and just feel hopelessly stuck. halp. \n\nI guess I'm posting this confession to ask for help or encouragement or commiseration, idk, so I won't feel as alone as I do now.",

    "message": "#13567 Good mental health is a two way street. It's important for MIT to provide good mental services that acknowledge the students problems and help them solve them. MIT can't possibly check up on each student when they don't show up to class, clubs, friend activities (otherwise, we'd be suing MIT for privacy violation). Also, it's not up to MIT to solve a person's mental health problem, that's for a trained clinician to do (otherwise, we'd all be saying it's okay to have a someone who is not a physician be your primary care doctor). Applying a slippery slope argument to MIT's court case doesn't help solve this issue (i.e. #13551). Also saying that MIT shouldn't prohibit contact between sexual assault victim and accuser and arguing that closing senior haus leads to more suicide seriously makes me concerned about your logic. Blaming Reif for every suicide also doesn't help students (#13550). In fact, if we keep on hating on the administration, it only makes those who are struggling less willing to seek out help because of all the antidotal things they hear/read. The onus is also up to us students to work with Reif and be reasonable. MIT already has pretty loose policies. Honestly, not many other school has an S^3 that is as supportive as ours (if they even have one), or the fact that you can drop a class one month before finals? Can MIT do more? Yes, but continue to blame MIT for everything you don't agree on makes me more concerned about your mental state than MIT's policies. Having so much hate never leads to good outcomes... Good mental health is also on the student to recognize when he/she needs help. And yes, from first hand experience, I know that's easier said than done. But not acknowledging your problems or refusing help makes it harder for someone else recognizing it and help you. MIT is there to support us, not coddle us. MIT is hard, but we also have to be okay with who we are and find help when we don't think we can do it alone (look, we all were the top of the class in high school and now, we're in a place where everyone else was also at the top). Blindly blaming MIT for suicides is unfair. We have to have a conversation, not a shouting match. Each party (students and administration) has to acknowledge our own faults and limits.",

And I'd appreciate it if you don't judge me for my choices. It's not selfish of me either. We are overpopulated. People struggle everyday to find jobs. I can dedicate my time doing things, like providing healthcare services, volunteering, researching cures for diseases, etc, etc. Instead of having children. So, no, I don't think choosing to have no children automatically makes me a selfish person. I don't go around judging you and saying you're a selfish person, bringing a child into this chaotic world. So, I'd appreciate it if you don't judge me or blow off my choice and believe I'll change my mind when I'm older.",

    "message": "#13522 LMAO at all these women complaining about yellow fever in their little feminist circles. It's getting so incredibly ridiculous now that there's even an article about it in the New York Times. The god damn New York Times. I mean really?  You won't change their racial preference anyway. The only thing you will change is that people will hide it better and be more subtle about it. That will make it only harder for clueless Asian girls to identify those guys with yellow fever. Ever thought about that?  Oh, and one more thing:  I totally understand if you don't want to be fetishized, but don't try to change their dating preferences. Just avoid dating these type of guys or avoid non-Asian guys in general, but don't take up space in a wolrd-renowned newspaper that would be far better suited for important political and economic issues.",

I believe potential parents should get tested and certified, before being allowed to sire kids.\n\nAs someone who have been raised in the shade of an abusive and violent parent, I'd say a psychological test and a criminal background check is the *bare* minimum. \nAnd yet I wonder if, should tests like these really exist, the potential parents' social-economic status should be taken into account.\nI really don't know. It may be patronizing, but raising a child is rather... an unprofitable venture. And yet, it seems as if some people do it offhandedly.\nIt bothers me from time to time.",

And if you post a distribution the day of the exam where the average is a 45, you better expect that people will be pretty fucking anxious about seeing their grades.  When you wait 5 days without any updates on grading, people are going to be pretty spooked and will consider dropping the course.  Most of us aren't the pure math kids who took the advanced version of this class in 6th grade and sail by with a 97 average.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, that I'm completely disconnected from the people around me, from my friends. I've spent the last few nights having breakdowns and crying myself to sleep because the loneliness is just getting too unbearable. I open up messenger wanting to message someone but my mind goes blank with nothing to talk about, or full of anxiety that I'm going to say something stupid. It seems like everyone is busy with their own work, or busy with people who actually have interesting lives. I instead blurt out off-handed remarks, make things awkward and just generally make myself look like a shitty person. I never feel like I can get close enough to people for them to actually give two shits about me\u2014I could disappear and nothing would change. I don't know if it's just me; that I am in some way unwanted or undesirable. I either feel like a burden or an afterthought, cuz I have yet to find someone who actually appreciates my presence and isn't simply apathetic to it. I can't get anything done because I'm always so burnt out\u2014not because of the work, but because of the complete lack of emotional support. I hate how I can solve any of my other problems but not ones involving my emotions, especially since this feels the only thing holding me back from living a normal life. I've been seeing someone at medical for a while now, but they simply can't medicate or talk away external factors. It is this very loneliness that pushed me to attempt a few times in the past, and I feel like I'm slipping now: I've been getting random thoughts about what might happen if I'm gone and I've only seen people feel guilt over not giving me enough attention, but where are these people now? I'm sick and tired of being told that I'm \"\"just looking for attention\"\" by people who have never been ignored in their life. Of course, I don't want to end it all; I know there are many things in life to live for. I just want this pain to end. \n\nHelp.",

I think that, for the most part, it would make sense for a person currently undergoing a sexual transition to eventually disclose to the other party (who may or may not be accepting of a gender transition) that they are in fact transgender. \n\nIf in the near future we were able to undergo gender reassignment surgery so perfect that one wouldn't be able to tell a female born at birth vs. male born at birth -> transitioned into a female, then would it/should it be something to be disclosed to others?",

Girls, you're not entitled to being treated like a princess. If you date an asshole, you should have seen clear cut signs early on he has no intention of changing for you, but you ignored it. That's on you, not the guy. Bottom line for both scenarios is you cannot force someone to do something they don't want to do. Love is a two way street.

A reasonable limitation on gun ownership shouldn't affect most of you -- unless you happen to be psychopathic.\n3. Why do people oppose gun ownership? Second amendment aside, hunting rifles are important to many people, so unless they can be ensured that they have an inalienable right to reasonably carry a sport rifle in hunting grounds, etc., there won't be sufficient support for gun reform.\n4. Why do people hate others who don't look like them? Immigrants are humans, black people are humans, Hispanics are humans... Why does it feel like only white people are humans in the US? And why are Asians do complacent in all of this? Asians literally get no benefit from anything race-related in the US: if being a minority is an \"\"advantage,\"\" then Asians don't count (education), yet when being a minority is a disadvantage (otherhood and being targets of racial violence), Asians suddenly become minorities again...

And don't even get me started on random ass trig identities or dumb ass log properties because that's another two separate rants entirely. I only need to know how to do a Taylor expansion to get the answer???? Yeah sure fucking thing, Patrick. I didn't even learn Taylor expansions in 18.02 when I was supposed to, and you think my dumb ass is gonna remember them now?? And this is just the shit I know about. I purposely didn't become a course 18 because it pisses me off so much, god knows what other fucking bullshit exists out there that I've yet to have a pset problem on. \"Simply take the Taylor expansion\" eat my ass",

But now I feel like I finished broadening out and I have no idea what I should be focusing on anymore. Classes just seem like a waste if I can't fold it into a master plan for at least some kind of short term goal. How do people settle on particular passions in life when you've never had a significant life event point you in some direction? I feel like I could pretty much choose anything I want to pursue and be able to succeed, but I can't decide which thing to do. I would normally try to prioritize things I am currently interested and then as I tackle the list, try to pivot as I better learn what I'm interested in, but everything on the list is so close in priority that it seems too arbitrary. Why does person X wanna be a doctor so bad, person Y want to work on AI research, and person Z want to build rocket ships and knew this preference for the last 5 years?\n\nPlz post thoughts and links to things that help answer all this",

Black Panther was an amazing example of how great a story is when you have black actors in black roles. e.g. I'm not saying that we can't have a black James Bond, but just don't call him James Bond.

I would love to talk to them directly, but I don't believe they could do anything with my input now. \n\nEvery other year has put hard work and design time into amazing rings, before and after my class, but I agree with the \"\"vocal minority\"\" that this year doesn't justify that effort. I'd also like to highlight the term \"\"vocal minority\"\". I too, was once upset to hear negative feedback on confessions about our ring (it will always happen) especially on things I personally put a lot of thought into. I entirely entirely entirely understand how the 20's might feel, but you should not neglect, invalidate, or simply brush off the negative feedback by calling it irrelevant altogether. You should learn from these comments, from both the good and upsetting. \n\nOne of our interview questions was literally how we would react and what actions we would take given overwhelmingly negative feedback.... and while I think the response this year certainly borders more on \"\"overwhelmingly negative\"\" than the historic \"\"vocal minority\"\", I'd understand if the committee didn't see it worth changing -- you can't make everyone happy. That's up to your discretion. \n\nI'm sorry 20's. I wish Ring Comm had a better mentorship structure where future years could get better guidance from the old folks. I would have loved to help or provide my feedback once or twice while I could, and part of me feels like I've let old Ring Committees down by not helping perpetuate a certain culture of design. \n\nMaybe the 21's will learn from the overwhelming feedback and change for the better.

Whereas the friends I talked to always understood my side as well, and in the case of what caused our breakup, generally agreed that both sides could have done things better. I definitely feel that I always tried to present my ex's side as best as I could when talking to my friends, but given how hostile they are to me at the moment, I'm not sure if they did the same for me.\n\nIn hindsight, would it have been a reasonable request for us to find a common third party to discuss issues with, to help each of us see the other side better? Isn't it common in couples therapy for both sides to see the same therapist? I know that there are things I could have done better, but I really can't believe that it was all me. I see a lot of opportunities where we could have fixed things together, but they've already made up their mind that it's not possible and that I've used up all my chances.",

When I'm in the house I feel like I'm in a literal ghost town, like how does no one in this sorority talk to each other?? \n\nIf I could go back I def would have joined APhi. It seems like they have a really beautiful sisterhood and friendship that I'm really jealous of... I wish our house was so gossip and drama free like theirs. Plus their house is right next to all the coolest frats with the hottest guys; we're stuck next around McCormick and douchey frats like PBE and KS... at least TDC is pretty chill",

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical campus \"\"hacking\"\" culture most of the jokes will go over a typical student's head. There's also the movement's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - Mass Tech's personal philosophy draws heavily from dormspam flame wars, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Mass Tech truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mass Tech's existencial catchphrase \"\"We Are Mass Tech,\"\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Mass Tech banner unfolds itself over Lobby 7. What fools... how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Mass Tech t-shirt. And no, you cannot see it.

    "message": "#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.\n\nI feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: \n\n1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  \n\n2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to \"do well\" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. \n\nMIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  \n\nBasically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",

I accidentally said \"goodbye! I love you!\". That was the first time I said I love you.  I immediately ran like a block away and just fell to the floor laughing and crying. It was quite a moment. I think about that moment sometimes and think wow, we are so in love right now. What a fuggin comeback. Here's the lesson folks, if the patriots can come back from a 3-28 game in the superbowl, and I can come back from accidentally telling my new SO 'I love you', then we all can come back from anything life throws at us, whether it be a bad grade or a fight with someone you care about or a rejection from your dream job, you can come back from it. We can all come back from anything, just reach out, take care of yourself, and believe. Goodbye, I love you all",

But the other part of me feels that I gave you my heart and soul, all I had to give, and if that's just not what you want anymore, then what we built doesn't work anymore, and I can't be mad about that, no matter how much I want to be.

If I tend to find taller men more physically attractive, does this make me racist against any race whose genetic composition makes members of that race, on average, shorter? For clarity, assume I don't have a \"height cutoff\" and can be attracted to shorter men for many other reasons, but height is generally a factor in my physical attraction.\n\nAlso, if I think brown eyes are very beautiful, more so than blue/green/etc eyes, am I being racist against any race whose genetic composition results in predominantly blue eyes?\n\nAt what point do I have the right to be attracted to one person over another without being racist? Why can't I be attracted to certain features more than others, if my attractions are based on those features and not on my knowledge of someone's race? And, since perhaps the genetic makeup of one race results in many people with many of the features I like, why can't I say that I'm more likely to be attracted to a member of that race? Remember, nowhere here have I said that this is a checklist. It's not that I'd *only* be attracted to people of that race. It's simply more likely because statistically there are more people with the features that attract me.",

Yeah Latino != White but even then Latino may not be specific enough. Are you talking about fair skinned Hispanics , who are quite frankly probably >75% European anyway. Cause yeah Spanish/Portuguese is Iberian and Iberian is white. A lot of Spanish have Arab, and Arab is also white soooo. You have motherfuckers in Cuba and Argentina that are like 100% European, and then you have the real og \"Brown People\" who are not even on social media because they're still stuck in places like Oaxaca or Arequipa. Even when talking about the whities, socioeconomic status is important cause a white guy from a ranch in Nuevo Leon != white guy from Polanco, Mexico City. Hey and honestly, I don't like the G word man. We should all respect each other. Commenters, what should we call American Whites when specificity is required such as in the Puerto Rico confession?

The situation snowballed into a major train wreck and I was deemed \"inadmissible\" for lifetime because of \"willful misrepresentation\" to the consulate officer, only that in my case I truly know it wasn't \"willful\". So here I was, stuck outside the US in the middle of my degree unable to resume classes at MIT and disconnected from 80% of all the people I knew.  I was badly depressed for a while but then gathered myself and started my blockchain startup in my home country. BTC and ETH are doing well and the hard work I put in for 3 years has started to pay off. But the two years I spent at MIT were the most fulfilling of my life and I so terribly wish I could finish my degree. My family wasn't wealthy so I couldn't really afford an expensive immigration attorney earlier, but there isn't a lawyer's fee now that I wouldn't be willing to pay to have even half a chance of getting a waiver to inadmissibility. I don't even know where to start. :/",

Really hesitant when it comes to breaking up but I feel it's time. Here's the issue: she won't let me lol. It's like whenever I bring up breaking up (in the past month) she starts to talk about how happy she will be when she sees me again/fun memories/why would we break up when we could work this out? And like that's great and all and I'm really trying guys but I can't find a way to break up like for realzies (part of me still wants to hold onto the relationship because love & stuff). Advice?",

    "message": "#11399 @11359 I'm really curious how common this sort of situation is? I feel like I'm in a similar situation (financially, family used to be doing not so great; parents made a lot of sacrifices and never really did anything for themselves in order to get my siblings and I the best education possible throughout our lives; money used to be hella tight;etc. But now, they're doing much better, and we live comfortably, though still without luxuries like trips or a new car and such), but I get excellent aid (tuition covered, and I cover my expenses + housing with work during the semester + my savings). All of my anecdotal experience points to MIT covering the people who need it, and the people I know not on financial aid, well, they live in giant houses and have been flying around the world all their lives; they don't seem to need it as much. Even the people I know who have gotten screwed at first were able to appeal and get things sorted out. Yet, there's been a lot of confessions/comments recently pointing to A LOT of major flaws in the system, and individual cases that were clearly poorly handled by finaid, such as yours.\n\nI'm really curious if there's any sort of complete data/survey information out there that would give a better sense of where these flaws in the system are coming from, and how they could be addressed. Is there some common theme to all these situations that is causing a lot of people to get screwed over? Some sort of anonymized dataset that could show how finaid correlates to income/assets/etc? Does MIT release any of that information? In addition, is there any sort of study that would show if it's more common for people on or off finaid to be going hungry? Is the issue that MIT isn't accounting for every situation, or simply not giving out enough aid across the board? I'm also really curious how the liquid assets of people on or off aid compare after you take out the portion contributed to MIT (or college in general in the case of multiple kids)? this seems like a number that should be fairly similar for most people, excluding those who make far less than the cutoff to start getting less than full aid and those who make far more than that cutoff + the cost of MIT); yet it seems like there's a lot of outliers. It just seems like looking at the data and figuring out exactly where the problem is will provide the best jumping off point for then starting to go to MIT and ask for change.",

It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. \n\nSo yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of. I need to harden, because people will expect a junior to coddle, not be coddled. I will never have this magical transition so many people have here, and it eats away at me because I missed this fun development process they got through no effort of their own.",

After working for a year at a cushy Course 6-related job and coming home for the holidays, I decided to catch up with some of my old high school friends that I used to be really close to. We still crack the same old jokes at each other and have a good time overall, but I find myself wanting to avoid talking about my new comfortable lifestyle, as many of them have struggled to find a job that they enjoy or relates to their major or doesn't exhaust them. I understand that this is the reality for most people and I appreciate the opportunities I've been given in this lifetime so far, but it hurts to see my old friends struggling to get by with jobs that they hate and/or wear them out mainly because of the different opportunities that were presented to us at the relatively young age of 17-18.",

When I ask you, my best friend, out on a date, it's not another person you sorta know asking you out: you don't understand how much I have agonized on the inside, consulted with friends, driven myself to madness, and repeated all the reasons to myself why I should back down and not risk this friendship. To say I have thought long and hard about whether to ask you out is an understatement. So I'm sorry that if after a couple of dates when you say you don't want to continue I am far more emotionally devastated than you could ever understand. And you may think you're helping by giving me space and retreating out of my life, but if you're going to do that, at least say that you are instead of leaving me wondering what I did wrong and confirming the biggest fear about asking you out: that I would lose my best friend. You don't understand the pain I go through every time you say you're not free to hang out, every time you don't want to sit next to me in class, and every time it's made obvious that I care about reestablishing our best friendship way more than you do. I'm over you romantically, but I'm not over losing my best friend. Please do something to show me that you still care",

I felt like I could say what I wanted to say and I could trust her not judge me and accept me for the weirdo I am.

I found out later that she apparently already liked someone else and the more I think about it the more laughable i think it was for me to think I had a chance. But I still like her and I don't know what to do with these bent up feelings. I just want to tell her how much she means to me, but who wants a person, whom they already told they dont like them, confessing to them out of nowhere.

    "message": "#10956 tl;dr: i'm a relatively affluent person and boy oh boy does money = privilege, this is something i try to be constantly aware of because it has made such a huge difference in my life\n\nI wanted to throw my two cents into the discussion about wealth and privilege, so here goes. My family is relatively affluent, and we live in a pretty well-off town. Both my parents grew up poor, so they've worked to make me aware of how much of a difference money can make. In some sense I've always been aware of this privilege - that I've grown up not having to worry about food and medical treatment and etc. I knew that even when family members were dealing with alcoholism and cancer and depression, we could afford to get them the help they needed. Even though it was awful to see people you love struggle with these problems, it felt like something was being done to help. So I've known that my family and I are extremely lucky to have the access to what we need.\nBut I wasn't really confronted with this until I came here. I was surrounded by people who were all roughly in the same income bracket as me for most of my pre-college life. After coming to MIT, I think I fully realized that class privilege isn't about the conspicuous consumerism or using the money you have at all. It's all the other things that come as a consequence of just having money - the security in times of trouble and access to resources because you're in the right places.\nBecause the town I lived in is pretty well-off, we had a really solid public school system - my family never felt the need to pay for private schools or tutoring, because between my own initiative and the support I had in these schools, I got a pretty solid education. I was able to take advanced classes and do research and intern at a company before coming here just by virtue of being in that town and meeting people there. I ASE'd a bunch of subjects because I had had the chance to take higher level math and science classes in high school, which is an opportunity other people just didn't have. Even if I didn't bribe my way into those classes and worked hard to test into them, the reason they were there at all is because my school was funded by the taxes that people in my town pay. I didn't have to pay a dime once I was in the school system, but just by being able to afford to live in that town I got a leg up on people who couldn't and thus ended up in worse schools. I've met people here who didn't have a fraction of the access to education that I did, and it really made me step back and think about the tremendous privilege that I have and how much easier it was for me to get here. That's not to say it was easy at all - but it definitely was easier.\n\nMIT really made me realize that class privilege is not as much about the money itself as it is about the access and support that just having money immediately gets you. Nobody is saying that because you're wealthy your life is rainbows and sunshine (although it might be, and in that case I'm really happy for you). Your problems aren't less valid that anyone else's. It's just also important for you to realize that other people have problems you just have never had to deal with and cannot probably begin to comprehend. And you've had access to things and support that other people haven't had even though they probably really could have used it, and that's huge. Just think about it a little bit.",

    "message": "#10887 As a person from a lower socioeconomic class, I feel intensely compelled to get everything I can out of my college experience. I want to study what I've always wanted to (physics, what got me into this school), and I want to avoid a bad socioeconomic situation afterwards so I'm studying for a CS minor. \n\nI feel like this is pretty unhealthy for me in its current form. A physics major is already pretty hard, and I'm pretty sure I have to study more than most other people to do decently well. Then doing the CS minor on top of that drains most free time I otherwise have left over (I also had no CS background at all, and worse math than most, so those CS assignments also probably take me longer). So then I'm missing out on other things I enjoy doing with my free time. But I feel like if I don't get the CS minor and a physics undergrad degree doesn't cut it (in case grad school doesn't work out, which might be the case right?), then a physics undergrad degree is meh and I might have not gotten as much of an improvement in my socioeconomic situation as I'd have wanted. So I feel like I absolutely have to study CS if I want to get a physics degree.\n\nThe alternative is to ditch the physics degree, study something more lucrative (probs CS), and take some physics classes I want to. But that's ditching everything I've worked for to get here in the first place, since I've just really wanted to do grad school physics research since mid-high school. ;( It's a dilemma. Anyone have tips?",

I feel like I should report it, but without concrete proof (just that most students verbally know that this person is cheating) it becomes a \"their word against my word\" type of situation. I don't want to create problems for myself by reporting this, especially if it looks like I attacked them without reason. Is there any way to deal with this or is it best to let karma do its job and assume that if he had to cheat to get into MIT, then he will likely not do well at MIT?",

I see my vote for neither of them as a screw you to the system (obviously who I voted for wasn't going to win, it wasn't about that). It's about time we stop only having two choices, and that's never going to happen if people just continue to choose the lesser of two evils. And before you make the old argument \"\"if you didn't vote for Hillary you don't care about minorities\"\", know that I am a proud queer woman of color. \n\n(@admins I'd really like this posted so if you need to take out the first sentence to do that go ahead :/ but please don't if you don't have to....don't post this request part tho)",

Guys are guys, they like to talk and would not like for your rep to be attacked. I know you are not about that one bit, and you deserve to be respected, which I would totally do if you had me, but as a friend I would like for you to be more cautious. Trust me, the guy friends you have now will continue  to be your friends because you're you. I for one are one of those friends. Maybe someday you will see me in the same way I see you.

It really gave me the gumption and backbone to just do what I wanted with my ECs and not be too highstrung with the profiles and stats and all that. My essays are pretty honest and from the heart. All that's left is to press the submit button and let the folks in admissions handle the rest. \n\nEven if I get rejected, it'll be fine. I did and studied what I liked in high school and am happy that I tried for a great school like MIT.",

Running your fingertips under a few drops of water for 1.2 seconds after taking a shit is not washing your hands. For goodness sake use some soap, or hand sanitizer, or at the absolute very least rinse off your ENTIRE fucking hand! So what if your hands get a bit dry in the winter that's what the fuck lotion is for so for fuck's sake WASH. YOUR. FUCKING. HANDS! We're adults (legally speaking) you should fucking know this by now. My 3 year old cousins do this shit better than some of y'all and those toddler-sized demonic fuckers can't even read. This is part of why people get sick and we all know nobody around here ain't got time for any of that shit. So just do the world a favor and wash your motherfucking hands.\n\nThat is all. Have a nice day :)",

Although I went into the class during PNR specifically because I didn't like Biology, I found that this class ended up being really fun for me. I loved how my TA would get excited about \"really cool stuff\" like trees and how he'd go off into tangents about research \"that happened really recently actually.\" I even liked that fact that he explained how viruses survive by saying how \"shitty\" they are at checking for mutations. His notes on my PSets would make me smile, especially when he'd put a little smiley face at the end. Giving us sugar and therefore energy from day 1 with those Starbursts, but last last recitation going on about how sugar lobbiests basically brainwashed the country into thinking it was fat that was bad for you (when it was really the sugar.) To this TA, I'd like to tell you that I definitely didn't talk as much in class as I could have, but I legitimately enjoyed recitation so much because you were my TA. Thank you so much for making this an awesome first semester at MIT and tbh, I still have that tiny crush on you.",

I sent up an Athena cluster printer to start printing, and then I went back to my computer because fuck standing at a printer waiting for 80 pages to print. After waiting for a bit, I went back to the printer to check on how it was doing, because it was probably close to being done anyways. What greets me is a stack of paper where every single sheet is completely black. I managed to single-handedly eviscerate an entire ink cartridge in one of the printers.\nOops.\nI think it was the weird format of the file that I downloaded that made the Athena printer shit itself. But now you guys know - if you think you've used the most ink out of any student at MIT, you're not even close.",

I recently came across a confession where, the OP was considering reporting a HASS class after they had to watch a disturbing movie for it. (It may be appropriate for them to personally skip that particular homework, but I do not believe that the professor is at fault for assigning that movie.)\nOn a similar note, though not directly related to the previous incident: There is a significant amount of people at MIT,  especially in my residence hall, who have beliefs/practices that are scientifically inaccurate and possibly harmful. Our classes cannot openly debunk these beliefs because that would be considered offensive.\nI understand that certain things are taboo, sometimes only in specific cultures, and MIT needs maintain their diversity by making everyone feel welcomed. However, censoring out these things would be like avoiding to face reality and, in an academic setting, this may impair the progress that can potentially be made. Thoughts?\n(It would be ironic if my confession got filtered out for bringing this up :/.)",

I knew another friend at my dorm who slept her best friend's ex. When her best friend confronted her about it, she got mad! Her argument was that as long as she wasnt hurting anyone, she's entitled to all the sex she could get.",

I hope everyone, including the BSU, realize that asking any handful of black people how they feel about a topic is not inherently representative of the opinions of black people as a whole, and that it is important to try to convey the diversity of black opinion (e.g. many blacks are fine with the idea of non-blacks wearing dreads)",

I cheer on these people all the time but never have anyone do the same for me even once. And it's not that I cheer others on because I expect the same in return, but because I really do believe in them. I guess people don't bother with me because I cheer on others so much that they think I cheer on myself? I've gotten to the point where I am unfollowing people on social media and avoiding them in real life to stop being constantly reminded of how inadequate and useless I am.

She'll get upset if I make plans to hang out with other people and when I invite her, she'll make my friends uncomfortable by acting surly and doesn't attempt to make conversation. She complains a lot about everything--her classes, the people around her, her friends and family back home, even small insignificant things! She always wants to be around me and it's mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with her all the time. I think she acts this way because she doesn't have many friends, but I don't want to be around her all the time with since it's really starting to have a negative impact on daily mood.

    "message": "#9801 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Robert A. Weinberg. The biological processes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical biology most of the explanations will go over a typical 7.012 student's head. There's also Weinberg's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The TAs understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these explanations, to realise that they're not just logical- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Robert A. Weinberg's lectures truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Weinberg's existential catchphrase \"In contradistinction,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robert A. Weinberg's genius wit unfolds itself in 26-100. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Robert A. Weinberg tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e",

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about \"Stanford being better than MIT\" to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. MIT will shit fury all over you and you will drown in all of the work you'll have here. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.",

I just feel like the material moves so fast in all of my classes that I have to half ass a lot of my psets. I don't have time to study, and once I get a few days behind, I have to give up on deep understanding to just get through the semester. I know I'm a reasonably smart person. If given adequate time to learn the material (which is assumed review for many), I'd do fine. It almost makes me wish I would have gone to an easier school, so I could have learned more. I haven't seriously thought about transferring becuase the people here are so great. Has anyone experienced something similar?",

    "message": "#9191 When I was a freshman I converted to Christianity from being raised in an atheist household. The biggest question I get now as a senior is why? Why despite being surrounded by reason did I make way for faith? There's a few reasons. The first is it makes logical sense from an odds perspective. There are two options there is or is not a God. You can choose to believe and worship, or not believe and worship. Lets say you believe and worship and there is a God. You get into heaven and it's eternal life, that's great. Let's say you believe and worship and it's all made up. Well you lived a good life, and it's not as if you can care anyway at that point. Let's go the opposite side of the coin, there is no God but you worship him, nothing happens again. Not a big deal, you lived a good life, and now you can't care after you die anyway. But lets say you don't worship, then after you die you go to hell. Now you are damned for all eternity. By worshiping you don't lose anything you can only win. Some people I know hate this piece from Voltaire, but it's tough to say it's flawed. The second is a greater need. A very clever priest pointed out to me that atheists had won and made America a secular society in practice. You can't possibly argue society is better now. Lack of faith has not given way to reason, as the last election pointed out. Look at the sexual revolution and culture change from the 60's and 70's. It's been a disaster. Divorce rates are sky high. People no longer look at their intimate partners as partners, but as trophies to be used and shown off who can be changed at will. Massive amounts of the population have turned to drugs to cope with the lack of emotional needs being met. We have essentially dehumanized each other. The big push backs to this are don't you care about peoples freedom and choice? Let me ask you this, should we be free to make our own choices on these matters? I say no. Most people, including us, when left to our own devices make poor decisions. The majority of Americans are now overweight for example, and have too much credit card debt, this includes the well educated. We can't even handle diet and budgeting. The other push back I get is we shouldn't be good only out of fear of punishment. That is true, we shouldn't have to, but unfortunately many people need that fear. That's why we have a system of laws as well. For 2000 years the western world has lived under a form of a strict Christian rule that produced a stable rising society. The idea that we can rule without it is brand new from a historical perspective and it's rather arrogant of us to think we have somehow learned more about logic and the needs of man then 2000 years worth of theologians and scientists, most of whom have done their work in the context of faith.",

I certainly feel like I've had some of those opportunities, but I feel as though there's not really that much positive reinforcement at this school. Throughout my time here, I've simply encountered feedback on how inadequate I was, no matter how hard I try sometimes. I guess it's good to know what my shortcomings are so that I can do better next time, but at the same time, I've never felt so dispassionate about my work as I do now. I've always known that there are lots of things I can improve, but I've rarely had an environment in which essentially everything that I tried to do turned out to be a failure.

Though I don't agree with all of Hillary's policies or all of Trump's, I really did think about this decision hard, and I struggled with it. Just because I voted for Trump doesn't mean I think he's anywhere close to a good person. Like many people who voted for Trump, I'm hesitant and worried about our country going forward. His presidential candidacy could very well turn out to be a total disaster, but I hope people can find enough grace in themselves to give him a chance. To be honest, I am very hurt by the amount of hate I see on my newsfeed toward Trump supporters. I see a whole group of people being generalized and put down as idiots, racists, rapists, and uneducated rednecks when these people could very well be the nicest people you know, someone's mom, or maybe one of your closest friends. To be honest, to the people wondering where all the Trump support came from, if you even gave people around you a chance to discuss these topics respectfully and try to convince them of your views instead of putting down Trump and his supporters - if you didn't assume that your friends voted for Hillary leaving them no space to say they were thinking about voting for Trump, maybe things could've gone differently. I am not trying to start an argument here, but I wish people who advocate for tolerance and justice would be able to respect that people who voted for Trump had their reasons. They have their values, and you shouldn't just assume yours are better than theirs.",

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, 'No, this is my first time.'\n\nSo she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.\n\n'Just a minute,' she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'Do these excite you?' She asked.\n\nWell, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.\n\n'Well, come on', she said, 'We don't have much time.' So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.\n\nShe looked at me with a bit of a frown. 'Did you put that condom on?' she asked.\n\nI said, 'I sure did,' and held up my thumb to show her.\n\nShe fainted.",

    "message": "#8369 I've been feeling very depressed lately - eating like crap, not talking to my friends, skipping classes, coming home late, sleeping too much or too little, failing tests and psets, surfing youtube rather than doing psets. I wake up with anxiety every single day. I have days when I spend the time I should be psetting curled up in my room or in a nearby bathroom having an anxiety attack, holding my head and waiting for the dark voices to go away. Sometimes they don't. \n\nPeople don't seem to notice this change. Why would they? I haven't made any friends close enough for me to open up to to care or notice. It's my fault I'm so alone. Yet, why do I feel so sad about this self-made situation. Maybe I'm just weak. In terms of workload, I have it super easy this semester. I've only had one or two quizzes this week for midterms, but my other friends have 3 or 4 midterms and psets together. They must be more stressed out than I am, but they're handling it better than me. I'm probably just weak.\n\nI know that people keep telling me to seek out friends because \"you can't get through MIT alone,\" but talking to people just seems so entirely worthless. Even if I do talk to people, it'll just feel like I'm being a nuisance to them; they won't really care. People only say that they care, but after you bother them too much, you just become an annoyance.\n\nI already tried going to MIT mental health, but I got the same vibe from them. When I told the psychiatrist that I was feeling sad, they pried for more information and I felt very attacked. Can't they just listen to what I have to say without getting so worked up about it? I understand that it's their job to make sure that I'm not in any \"immediate danger,\" but at the same time, couldn't they see me as a person rather than as just another patient they need to hurry up and fix? They didn't even seem to be interested in what I was saying when I was happy - listening and nodding with the same bored and distant eyes as all the other people who said they \"cared.\" They don't really care; It's just their job. When my hour is up, they would just tell me to wrap it up and ask for another appointment time. If I can't even open up to the psychiatrist without being judged and possibly sent to a mental hospital for the slightest misstep, who else can I trust? After a few weeks, I just feigned happiness and never went back again to mental health again.\n\nNow I'm more depressed than ever. It's so hard just getting through every single day. Who am I living for? What am I living for? What's the point anymore? I don't know what to do. I can't ask MIT Mental Health help because they'll just send me to a mental hospital. I can't talk to friends because they honestly don't care and will just find my constant depression annoying. I can't tell my family because I don't want them to worry.

A lot of them tell me to stop complaining because they're independent and they know what it's like to rely on themselves, but they really really don't. They still have something of a safety net. I've seen them have it-- when they got sick, their parents sent them soup. When they wanted to buy their brass rats, they got loans from their parents. When their boyfriend/girlfriends broke their hearts, they talked it through with their parents. I mean, like I'm happy they're independent and have grown out of needing their family, but I never got to grow out of needing my family. I took care of my parents, not really the other way around, and it bums me out sometimes. \n\nI'd give anything to know what it's like to call your mom at the end of the day and talk about school and life and the cute guy that I'm crushing on in my morning class, and to have the conversation end in an \"I love you, no matter what anyone tells you, you're doing great.\" \n\nI really really try not to feel sorry for myself because it's useless, and most of the time I'm really happy with my life (cuz like shit, I'm at MIT) but goddamn, am I jealous sometimes.",

    "message": "#8261 Sometimes I wonder if MIT was a good fit for me. I'm pretty involved on campus politically and there are the few that get excited about making change. But a lot of times it feels like talking to an echo chamber.  A friend told me that MIT is apathetic because politics isn't something that really affects upper-middle class STEM professionals in a noticable way.  But we don't live in a vacuum as much as this page suggests.  I really want to believe that not as many people act apathetic because they really don't care but because they don't know how or why to care. If there are more opportunities to get involved and people understand how the system can create change in our lives then maybe people will also pay more attention.  Whether its funding research, better healthcare, better STEM education, more opportunities and jobs, or just being able to feel like you have a say in the system that structures your life, politics isn't this just a thing that loud overly opinionated people do. It's a way of engaging your community and making it better for everyone.  You can register to vote, help people register, get involved with MIT Democrats, Republicans, whatever you stand for, generally read news, learn about how things in Cambridge change and get changed, whatever it is you want to do to feel engaged.  It's a wonderful feeling and I wish I more people around me had it.",

We had strong, supportive families that valued education and made many sacrifices for it.  Our invitation to MIT meant our years of hard work were finally recognized. Most admissions applications mentioned the strong bonds between MIT parents and students. As an MIT mom, I was the person who always believed my student could succeed even when they doubted themselves. The emotional turbulence at MIT is not limited to students. My confession and that of many MIT moms I know is how painful it is to spend almost two decades giving so much more than the parents around us only to find out that on Mother's Day our students that we were once so close to, either barely acknowledged us or forgot us altogether.

She tells me, 'Honey, I'm wet' come and gives me an unbelievable lap dance. To my surprise, my manhood doesn't respond. She goes on to unzip my shorts so as to give me a hand job with those soft, soft hands of hers. Still nothing. So I dress up and we go to the big party. She like starts grinding on me (damn. She's horny) like it's yolo and my thing is still flaccid. Damn John. Why? her rhythmic thrusts become more pleasingly violent and sexual. Still nothing. We put in a like a great hour of grinding and then head back to my single. I like start touching her everywhere along they way. Boobs. Butt, legs you name it. Still nothing. We get into my single and we have the best foreplay ever only that John is MIA. FUCK. So her orchid starts playing around john - the finale. Nothing. She blows me nothing. I masturbate. Nothing. I masturbate to porno in the bathroom. Nothing. So i escort her to her dorm. She says she's had a great time. Kisses me passionately. Nothing. Fuck u diff eq for stressing me out until i get ED.

In addition, there are diaper changing tables that you can place your laptop on, so you can sit on the toilet and have a wank without dealing with shit quality mobile streams, or having to try and balance your laptop on your knees while wanking. Finally, there is always an abundance of tissues, soap, and hot water to clean up after you're done. What more could you need?",

    "message": "#6549 Every semester I've been here I've gotten an email from a concerned professor about my performance. This year both times it happened I just got really annoyed, even though I know they mean well. I've accepted that I'm a C student, because MIT forced me to. I recently switched to the flexible version of my major with a HASS minor so I wouldn't have to take hard classes anymore, but even now on 36 units of easy classes, even with all that extra time to commit to individual classes and the lack of sleep deprivation, I'm still getting that email. But it's still so much better than how it used to be, when I tried to be a normal MIT student taking a normal 48 units while taking all the classes required for my major. I worked my ass off, got lots of help, went to office hours, went to S3, never slept, went to Mental Health and got a prescription for Adderall, generally did everything right and then some, and still barely passed my classes, assuming you count a D as passing. It sucked. Maybe if I went back to that lifestyle on my lighter courseload I could be an A-B student, but I was so fucking miserable, and it's not worth it. If a low GPA is the price for my sanity, I'll take it. My blood pressure dropped almost 30 points from near-hypertension levels back to pre-MIT levels when I made that transition. I refuse to go back.\n\nBut I still have to meet with my professor to talk about how to fix my apparently problematic grades, which was a shock because I was enjoying that class. For the first time I was understanding what I was learning in a technical class, and I got full credit on some pset and exam problems, which is also a first. This professor is so much nicer than other professors too. I'm so used to being treated with contempt by professors, but he treats me with respect and it's such a shock. I don't know what to tell him. Usually the message I get from these meetings is, \"just get higher scores.\" Guess I just have to grin and bear it like always and flounder my way to graduation.\n\nIHTFP is not a cute little thing with double meaning for me. I genuinely, deeply, hate this fucking place.",

    "message": "#6480 So I just read that the US may start forcing women to register for the draft and I think that's fucked up on many levels. The idea is that if women want the same rights as men then we should serve along side men. And I realize that the draft is rarely used but this is isn't even about equal rights and using that as the reason behind this is fucked up. If it was really about equality, then the military officials deciding this and pushing for this bill should not be mostly men. And frankly if the military can't even ensure the safety of women in combat now, specifically when it comes to sexual assault, what do you think is going to happen if women are forced to be there? \n\nI am personally very anti-war and think no one should have to register for the draft regardless of sex. But if this is really going to be about equality, then I want the same men that think it is right to send women off to kill others and/or die to give me and other women the rights we actually deserve. Rights like full access to birth control, feminine products (without a pink tax), equal pay, and the right to decide what to do with my own body without the influence of government.\n\nI get that a lot of people may agree with this bill and I'm not \"anti-America\" for disagreeing with it. I just think it's wrong to use women's rights and equality as an excuse to force people to serve the military, especially when the military is not the only (or often even the best way) to serve your country. These men don't actually care about women's rights. If they did they would have done more about sexual assault in the military and other women's rights issues in the US.\n\nI'm just irritated now. It's late, I'm tired, and what I read just made me really angry so I probably did not develop my points as well as I should have or even used the most proper and/or accurate terms, so I guess you can say this was more of an angry rant. I'll do more research on this later but I just wanted to blow off some steam right now.",

It took MIT over 3 years to make Add/Drop forms be online.  It still hasn't done this for minor forms.  If that takes at least 3 years then even considering a change to any of the things you listed will take well over that amount of time.  In a way, it is discouraging. But I think the better way to think about it is that the world won't change overnight either - it should be a lesson of perseverance and determination to enact change and not get discouraged if it takes a really long time.  \n\nTo be clear though, I'm not justifying MIT's slowness to change. I'm against huge bureaucracies for this reason. I'm also not a fan of saying at least we're more progressive than the Ivies where it takes even longer to change things. We shouldn't compare ourselves to anyone we should just do the shit that needs to be done.",

This may sound weird or stupid, but over the past few months, I've started realizing I have really strong feelings for you. I know that nothing will ever come of it because of geographical distance (we won't even be in the same country after graduation.) I also don't think you see me as anything more than a really good friend. Regardless, I feel lucky to know you. Anyone would be so lucky to have you as a friend.\nI wish the best for your future and hope you fulfill all your dreams. You work really hard, and you definitely deserve it! No matter who you end up with in the future, I hope she realizes how lucky she is to have a guy like you.\nSincerely,\nK",

    "message": "#6060 This issue has been on my mind for a long time and after watching the last democratic debate, I realized I had to make this post. I am quite honestly astonished by the sheer number of Bernie Sanders supporters at MIT and other elite institutions of higher learning across the U.S. \n\nWhile I actually agree whole-heartedly with him on social and foreign policy issues, his fiscal and economic policies are as absurdist as a 1972 Luis Bu\u00f1uel movie. Not only would a 15 dollar minimum wage instituted at a federal level decrease overall social welfare but it would actually hurt the poorest people of the country the most. There would be much fewer jobs for American workers and more jobs outsourced. People that are willing to work for less aren't able to. Of course certain cities/ states can viably maintain a 15 dollar minimum wage which is why it has been instituted at those levels. Then Sanders goes on to say that he would be in support of regulation that would make it illegal for American companies to outsource jobs and would like to see an end to most of our free trade agreements with China, NAFTA, etc. This is almost comedic in stupidity. If that regulation was actually passed, companies would simply move out of the U.S which would hurt the economy even more. Tapping into the global economic ecosystem is crucial for American success in the future and it is a backwards view to isolate ourselves. Finally, at the crux of Sander's economic policy is the villainizing of the rich. It's clear through all the various debates that he views rich people as greedy, evil people that provide no value to society. This simplified and narrow-minded view is ignorant. Yes the previous recession was in part caused by \"greedy\" leaders of banks but from a higher perspective the actual problem was caused by mis-aligned incentives on the part of the federal reserve and U.S government. Additionally, the finance industry is largely responsible for the innovation and growth of the American economy throughout much of the past decade, which Sanders clearly doesn't know/ acknowledge. \n\nNo Bernie, I refuse to \"feel the bern\", and I would highly encourage fellow MIT students to consider the consequences of these fiscal/ economic policies thoroughly before blindly hopping aboard the hype train.\n\n-concerned MIT senior",

    "message": "#6048 This question may sound bad but please hear me out, I mean this in the least judgmental way possible: Why do Asians feel like they're underrepresented here? Asian Americans represent about 5% of the US population but at MIT represent about 30% of the student population. Meanwhile US population vs MIT population for other races respectively is about 12% to 10%(even though many black students will say that is number is more realistically 5-6%) for Black students, 16% to 14% for Hispanic/Latino students, and 63% to 51% for White/Caucasian students. (I'm not including the numbers for international students, undocumented people, or other smaller or foreign groups because the numbers on specific groups are a bit fuzzy.) But according to these numbers, how do you feel underrepresented? Again, this is out of pure curiosity. I do not mean this in any judgmental or possibly racist way. I just overheard a few Asian pre-frosh talking about discrimination in admissions processes and feeling underrepresented at a school like MIT and I just want to understand your perspective better.",

It's literally two opposite corners of the globe, so it is always hard to relate to people based on some key elements from this culture. \nSecondly, I find it hard to keep a conversation going most of the times. It feels like people doesn't care what I'm passionate about/I don't care what the people I'm meeting are passionate about. This might also be a big reason why I de so antisocial, but how can I break out of this circle? \nFinally, due to spending most of my high school life after some very special extracurricular activity, I am mote used to being in a clique than being in a friend circle that's more of a sparse graph. But it takes time to build a clique anywhere and in the meantime I am feeling awkward and lonely. Any suggestions?",

My parents disagreed and it has been point of contention. A few years later I started applying to summer internships and many of them had a 3.0/4.0 minimum GPA requirement. I only had a 2.8/4.0. I thought, \"Shit, my parents were right, I should've tried harder. It's going to be more difficult to find a job than I thought.\" I applied to six, got interviews at my top two choices, and received an offer from one of them. I'm really excited :D I guess I shouldn't have tried harder after all?",

All I wanted was a note from S^3 excusing my mandatory attendance class and maybe allowing me to be late on a pset. Instead, I found my dean was incredibly emotionally manipulative, making me think I couldn't handle what had happened and needed more drastic measures (going to mental health, time off, regular meetings). I wondered (and still do) if this sort of emotional manipulation is why so many MIT students are dependent on S^3 deans. \n\nI made up some lame excuse about having a meeting and eventually ghosted them when the dean kept asking for follow-up meetings, and never went back, even when stuff got rough over the next four years.

    "message": "#4643 I really did not think that college students would still act like high schoolers when it comes to being with friends.  I mean, if you don't like someone then that's one thing, and if you have a certain group of people you usually do stuff with, then good for you.  But if you have a friend that wants to hang out with your click or whatever, then why is that friend all of a sudden cast in the shadows as if he/she isn't even there?\n\nIt really doesn't make sense, especially if you are very familiar with everyone in the friend group.  Personally, I'm really struggling with the fact that I am being marginalized by people that I've gotten to know since September, and it really makes me sad knowing that I can't hang around these people without always feeling like a stranger to them.  Yes, I could hang out with other people, and that's what I've been doing nowadays.  The problem is, I see these people just about everyday, and that always reminds me that for some unknown reason, I can't interact with them the way I used to.  \n\nIf they don't want to be friends, it would be nice to know so that this problem doesn't continue to weigh on me.  And if they do want to be friends, well it would be nice if they could start treating me like one.",

It's been a while since I've felt like I've gotten anything out of human interaction, when I talk to other people I just feel nothing.  It's not that I'm super awkward - most people who know me probably thing in fairly normal.  I just feel like a robot sometimes.  I don't want to be this way, and I've tried to change things and make an effort to socialize more, but when I go back to my room at the end of the night I just feel as empty as ever.  Maybe I haven't tried hard enough or put myself out there enough, but I'm starting to lose faith in my ability to experience human connections and lose hope of ever being normal.",

We want a society that allows free discourse of all ideas. A society that is tolerant of all ideas cannot import people who are intolerant of all ideas, as that is destructive to that society. Whether you wish to acknowledge it or not, Western liberal ideas are primarily held by those who are from Western liberal societies and those that have been influenced by Western liberal societies. Immigrants must assimilate into our culture for our society to survive. Most individuals from certain cultural backgrounds have shown themselves incapable of assimilation. We cannot allow these people into our society. A tolerant society paradoxically must be intolerant of those who are intolerant.\n\nThose on the right, understand that the left is fighting for equality of opportunity for all people regardless of who you are. Just as you are opposed to socialism because it takes money from those who work and gives it to those who do not, you must also be opposed to allowing dynasties of elites to form, as is the case in libertarian societies. When your parents die, you receive money you did not work for. You have no claim to that money, and thus a society must make the funds available to the public. Give every individual the chance to become a leader. Competition breeds strength.\n\nThe Meritocracy Party is the only political organization promoting an agenda that will eliminate dynasties of wealth, provide equal opportunity to all people, and maintain our society and culture.",

Being able to talk about the assault is helping me come to terms with it. It took three weeks for me to even admit to anyone that something happened, another two to admit that the guy did more than forcibly kiss me, and four after that to admit it was rape. Is it really that horrible of me to talk about it in public?",

    "message": "#3923 Men say the damndest things you know. Let me say it again. Men say the damndest things. Donald trump continues to make ignorant, degrading and highly inaccurate comments about the Latino race every time it  he steps to a podium. Kayne West continually insists that aside from being considered \"The Greatest Rapper in the World, his name should also be included in future editions of the king james bible. Charlie sheen, after causing $7,000 worth of damage at a hotel just months after a reported assault on his third wife had the audacity to go on national television and announce that he was winning. Men, I will repeat \"Say the damndest things. But of all the damndest, of all the foul, of all the crooked and vulgar things that a man could expunge from the hole in his face he identifies as his mouth can not do justice to the depravity that expunged out of one mongrels townies mouth while I was walking in Charlestown yesterday evening. Being that it is February and the weather is to some degree getting a tad bit warmer I decided that perhaps the time hap come to wear something a tad bit more comfortable and possibly a little more revealing. I looked into my closet and found y wardrobe for that day. I exited my dorm room at exactly 10:15 on the dot yesterday. I'd been invited to Charlestown for a party that was to be held by my roommates cousin. Being a stranger to Boston, having resided down south in Houston, Texas all my life I had no knowledge of Charlestown. That is with the exception from that time I saw \"the town\" at tommy whexlers party in the ninth grade. Beyond that my knowledge was limited. The party was badass and the food was off the hook. Though not as glamorous as the area surrounding Mit, I will admit it has a certain gruff style about it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. That is until it was time to go. While walking down the sidewalk back to the subway that would take us from Charlestown back to our destination we encountered what my friend later identified to me as a townie. I don't rember the exact definition she gave me as to what this particular breed of man was. I'm not even concerned with the definition she gave me. What mattered was his comment. a comment so vulgar, so dehumanizing, so nasty that it makes me insides boil up like hot water, my head burn like fire, and my entie body to shake with rage and fury. \"GIRL, WHEN I\"M DONE WIT YOU U GONNA BE SQUIRTIN, AND SCREAMIN, AND SHAKIN ALL OVER THE GODDAMN PLACE. SKIT,SKIT,MOTHERFUCKUCKA, GODDAMN!\" If i'd had a gun idda popped a cap in his ass. If I had been in possession of a pocket Knife, id have castrated him. If id had peper spray I'd go up and spray the entire goddamn bottle in his eyes. Fortunately for him I was in possession of none of this items. Fortunately for me there was one thing I did and will always possess. My voice. Ladies, let me tell you something bout a woman's voice. A womans voice is the most valuable thing  a woman could ever have.  a voice is all the thing a woman ever needs. In the 1920s when men said that women were not intellectually capable nor necessary to the voting process Susan B Anthony said blatantly \"Fuck That> In 1955 when White male police officers in Alabama told Rosa Parks to get off the bus and move to the back of the bus after a long day of standing on her knees, she said \"Fuck That. In 1989 during a live television broadcast of the David lettermen show, the host in question had the audacity to remark on the current weight of one oprah winfrey and furthermore thought his comments to be justified. she said \"Fuck That\" So when this spineless, needledick dweeb had the audacity to sit on his stoop and call out to me in such a manner I did what women throughout history have and I pray, will continue to do when a man feels that he can speak to you in a dehumanizing matter. I said fuck that.  Look here you dickless piece of shit. I don't what you think this is but I aint the motherfucking one! You hear me I ain't the motherfucking one! Youre gonna have me squirting and screaming?! As if id waste my time spreading my legs for that tootsie role dick. Go home and give it a tug. Youre jacked up, you hear me jacked up. You heads jacked up you, your face is jacked up, your bodys jacked up, youre just a plain jackass. You must be a jackass to think that I would ever under any circumstances respond to a man informing me that I am nothing more than an object for him to eject his smelly infertile load on. You must be a jackass to assume that I who am talented  female currently receiving and education at one of the finest schools in the country would ever lower herself to do such a thing. you must be a jackass to throw such shade at a girl who is spirited, beautiful, funny, and downright badass. Im a woman. Mother of the earth. The cradle of civilization. The giver of life and it all its miraculous wonders. I am a fucking gift. A gift that shitheels like you don't or care to recognize. Now, where you come from, tht kind of behavior may be tolerated. Girls may respond to such outrageous and vulgar coometns. But, Im a lady goddammit! and I demand to be treated the way a lady should be treated. So if, EVER I AM IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WE CROSS PATHS  AND YOU MAKE AS VULGAR AND DEHUMANISING A STATEMENT AS THE ONE YOU JUST MADE IMMA PUT YOU IN A HEADLOCK, BEND YOU OVER THAT RAIL, AND PUT MY HIGH HEELED SHOE SO FAR UP YOUR ASS YOUR GONNA HAVE TOES FOR TEETH! Men say the damndest things I tell ya. Men say the damndest things.",

    "message": "#3879 The issue with modern day social justice techniques:\nI can't tell what is being asked of me.\nI feel like things are more relatable if you ask for some well-defined goal to be met. For example, wanting women to have the right to vote. That is a goal with clear metrics and observable change. It is immediately understood if the goal is met or not.\nNow, a lot of the talk I am exposed to seems so abstract. I hear more about a passionate \"we will overcome this\" mindset than I hear about what metrics are being used. I think, for the sake of everyone, it is better to at least define some goals, even if they are a proxy for what is actually desired. I understand things are complex... But I will only ever live within my own set of experiences, so the more relatable and understandable your problems are to me, the more I will naturally support your side. I feel hesitation and uncertainty when I try to support something that sounds abstract and purely subjective.\nBy the way, I actually think this approach will gain a larger and more diverse following. Instead of focusing on limiting and scolding others for certain actions, focus on asking for a logical, desirable change. I understand it may feel like you are catering to the whims of the privileged with this method, but I believe the mutual understanding and support that can be achieved is more than worth it. The other abstract arguments may follow, but only after spearheading the campaign with clear metrics.",

But it's such a community, with the silverware/food/couch/everything kleptos; we all live together like a family and send out angry/threatening/'stop taking my red sweater get your own and grow up damn it' emails like a dysfunctional family. \nI was reading MIT confessions and I saw the hatred for the Burton-Connor lady and then there was the Senior Haus confession. We lovingly tease our housemaster and AD and house manager; I have yet to see any actual tension arise between residents and the house team (except in the case of Ken meets fire hazard but that's more of a Ken-fire-hazard personal issue) and it's one of the few things that truly make finals week significantly better. \nSeeing the stark contrast between how we feel about our house team and the BC people, how many haus people respond to haus confessions in fun ways, it hits home that the reason I'm still here is because there's no other place that I could imagine being even relatively happy. I'd rather be holed up in my room psetting/studying 80% of the day here than anywhere else because, at the end of the day, yes, it is the most unique place I've ever seen.",

She is completely out of touch with the students she claims to serve, refuses to listen to their concerns, and fails to advocate for their well-being. She is a source of pain, stress, and frustration for students, and actively goes out of her way to prevent socialization betweenus by false accusations, appealing minor complaints to higher administration, and ignoring student opinions about student life in the dorm.

I'm his girlfriend, his better half, his significant other, his soon to be within a matter of 365 days his wife. And he facialed me. He fucking facialed me.! Ladies chivalry is motherfucking dead I tell you! Dead! It has to be dead when youre fianc\u00e9 in the heat of reaching the climate of his sexual excitement decides to deposit the evidence of that heightend sexual excitement on your face. Wtf? No motherfucking respect none. He didn't even ask me if he could facial me. That what bugs me. He didn't straight up and ask could he start cinco de mayo early on my face, he decided to cum(pun intended) without any formal invitation. And why my face? Why my motherfucking freckle free face? He could have cum any where else? My tit, my stomach, my arm, hell even my hair. But no. he had to fucking cum on my face. Ladies I don't think I need to tell you that the face of a lady is the window to the soul, the key to her inner workings, the mechanics of her deign. A woman's face is her temple. It is also her weapon. A woman's face Is a weapon. A weapon whose greates attribute is that it conceal. O how it can conceal. Heartbreak, disappointment, anger, resentment. Yes our faces hide all behind a smile. That's what I gave him a smile. As I was I situated on my knees, face covered in his baby gravy. I gave him a smile. Why. To rlay a message. To relay him a message. Everything is allright. Eveyrthing is ok. The fact that you just deposited your stinky load on me is inconsequential. Two minutes later as he feasted on my mossy bank I moaned. O how I moaned. Not because he is a skilled pussy eater. Oh no. He cant eat pussy worth shit. He can throw down in the bedroom but eating pussy is not his specialty. But still I moaned. I moaned for my revenge is perfect. Tomorrow I start my period. Tomorrow according to the calendar is when the parting of the red seas begin. And I'm gonna make damn sure he's in the same position he's in now. Ironically he hates twilight. You and Edward are about to have something in common.",

We will start a tradition, the Infinite Streak, that on the night before finals begin every term (Sunday, Dec 13, this term), we meet in Lobby 7 just before 10pm, and at exactly 10pm, strip naked, and run down the Infinite and back.  All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc.  Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.\n(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again.  What do I wear when I show up?  Clothes or a towel.  Where do I leave the clothes?  In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends.  Why doesn't the run go outside?  Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside.  What about cameras?  Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them.  Do I have to be totally naked?  It's encouraged, but we certainly can't require it.)\ntl;dr - Dec 13, 10pm, Lobby 7, strip and then naked run down and back the Infinite",

Even desire to self harm shouldn't do it as long as you don't describe it as at the level of seriously considering suicide. This is coming from someone who WAS forced to leave. I said A LOT to S^3 and Mental Health before it got to that point. Try going back to S^3 and asking to see Miri Skolnik. She has always been super sensitive in my experience. Also, to you and anyone else, if you are seriously contemplating suicide, please get help even if you are scared of getting kicked out. MIT IS NOT WORTH DYING OVER.Yes, sometimes withdrawals are coerced (which, of course, is pretty concerning), but it takes a decent amount to get there, more than suicidal thoughts, if a low level of intent is expressed. And if you do have to leave, there is a decent chance you will be able to come back eventually. Plus, you can always see a therapist outside of MIT. No risk of withdrawal then :)",

I may take for granted sometimes my intelligence, but I never forget even for one second that there are other students that work twice as hard as I do and still aren't able to pass classes.\n\nWith this in mind, it really bothers me when someone does poorly on a test and when I try to console them or encourage them that they can do better next time, they never take me seriously. They tell me \"you couldn't understand, you've never failed a test before in your life\". They tell me, \"even when you think you've done badly, you still usually beat the average\". \n\nSince when does doing better than other people define whether we're doing well? Why can't I feel as if I've done poorly if I didn't live up to my potential, no matter how far above or below average I was? It's not about doing better than other people, it's about doing better than you think that you can do.\n\nAnd even more, since when does our grades define the quality of our lives? Just because I've never failed a test doesn't mean that I don't know what it means to fail, to be disappointed in myself, or to face hardships.\n\nI guess I just wish that people would realize that when I say that I know that they can overcome this, and that it will be ok, they're not empty words.

One question I frequently get asked, I would like to address here. The question is, \"why doesn't your church do things to be more fun, accept birth control, cohabitation, female priests, and other serious changes\". People usually add to that how those changes would bring back young people in droves. Lets talk about fun, church is not meant to be fun. Church is about learning how to live your life, and to keep you on the right path. Lectures here are not always fun, but you still go, because you understand their need. People who leave church because it's not, \"fun\", are like people who leave lectures here they paid for, they missed the entire point. Next, accepting homosexuality, cohabitation, female priests, etc, etc. The reason we do not do these things is because all of these things are against the core doctrines of our church. We follow the lessons of the bible, the bible strictly forbids cohabitation and birth control violates the spirit of being open to life. We also forbid them because we empathize putting others before yourself, this includes creating stable working families, where you put the needs of the other members before yourself, even if it is at your own detriment. Cohabitation encourages you to seek your own pleasure, above the needs of others. (There is also plenty of psychological research showing this.) Some people have argued against this from a survival standpoint saying we should do it anyway just to get new members. We are not a popularity contest. Jesus when asked if he was king replied, \"My Kingdom is not of this world\". We are not a worldly crowd, nor do we want to be. And even if we were, the majority of students here at MIT would not show up anyway. You would all know that we were changing the doctrines in a cynical attempt to bring you. Did you know there are many new protestant sects that accept homosexuality, female priests, cohabitation, and other things? If you ask why you haven't heard of them it's because they collapse almost as fast as they rise. People stay faithful because faith challenges them, not tells them what they want to hear.

    "message": "#2979 2888, I still have nightmares about you, not super often, but still.  Either aboutsomehow \"accidentally\" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had.  I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship.  Never treat someone how you treated me.  Your last message makes me hope you did learn.  You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.  \n\nI want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else:  No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety.  I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them.  Do not let them hold you hostage by your love.  If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them.  Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff.  If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly.  If they say, \"if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]\", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you.  Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real.  If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change.  You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again.  Leave them.  Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it.  Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more.  Never let fear control you.  \n\nIf you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR.  They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually  really difficult if you are blinded by love.  Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you.  Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.\n\n-2924",

    "message": "#2924 @2888, this sounds like you.  Leaving you for good is the thing I am most proud of myself for doing. If you weren't so horrible to me I wouldn't have been strong enough to do it.  I let myself feel the horrible pain of losing you, I let myself feel it completely and didn't try to villify you to stop me from caring.  But finally, I stopped caring.  I stopped thinking about you and feeling like I would see you again.  I used to think we were soulmates, that there was no way we wouldn't die together just based on how close I felt to you.  I still remember but what I can see clearly now is all of the abuse you put me through. That was some text book emotional abuse and it wasn't OK and I will never stay with someone who does even a fraction of what you used to do.  That's why its so easy now to forget you.  After I stopped caring about you I was alone and it was beautiful.  To not have to fucking answer to anyone.  And then I met someone and I fell in love again.  Its different and so much better.  He is so much better to me than you were, he never tries to hurt me, he makes me so happy. I might marry him in the future.  Anyway, i deleted my response so many times because I didn't know where this message would end or exactly what I wanted to say. Basically I am so proud of myself for leaving you, but am grateful of everything I learned because of it.",

However, he also has never cleaned our room, never cleaned the bathroom (and leaves trash all over it, even though it is tiny and has a trash can), rarely showers or does laundry and thus often smells very bad, and leaves horrible smelling towels in our room and bathroom. All of these things annoy me, but since he never complains about anything I do (except sometimes opening the windows when he is particularly bad smelling), I don't want to be obnoxious or confrontational and have to talk to him about all of those things. Should I? Can I (does he have the right to not wash his hands or leave stinky towels lying around)? Do I have to pick 2? Please help.",

    "message": "#2890 I feel like the question of Syrian refugees is simple, but not in the way I see some people breaking it down. The choice as I see it is A) Does the US accept the refugees, knowing it is likely that some percentage of them will be malicious agents taking advantage of the crisis to immigrate, or B) Does the US accept none of them (or perhaps a third option, does the US accept a subset that is likely to be harmless? Eg. children only, though that would be heartbreaking for those families and not necessarily the best option for those children, etc.).\n\nTo argue that innocent refugees should be welcomed because they're decent human beings is to argue against a straw man (Well, it may SHOULD be arguing against a straw man, though some politicians' comments seem to indicate they might actually be opposed to this sentiment...). If governments had divining rods that could tell who was and wasn't intending to perpetrate violence on others, this decision would be much more straightforward.\n\nI just wanted to articulate this distinction. I think it's very possible to be in favor of A) above; but the proper articulation is \"I support accepting all of the refugees, because helping the innocent ones is more important than preventing the damage that might be caused by the malicious agents\", not simply \"I support welcoming Syrians\". (Does this sound accurate to people? I am by zero means a domain expert, here)",

And now he wants a \"strong\" girlfriend. That's fine but why the hell did you keep coming back to me all semester, begging me to take you back, pretending to be nice, while spending a lot of time with a \"hardass\" girl from your new dorm? I trusted you and took you back because I loved you, it was my excuse. But what was yours for messing with me? You did not tell your friends that you keep coming back, the last time just a few weeks ago, because you knew they would be disgusted with you. But you made me stronger now. And please, don't try to come back again after you will be kicked out by this \"strong\" girl pretty soon (\"strong\" girls usually are not into your cheesy style). And girls, DON'T BE NICE to immature jerks who will only use it against you.",

Focusing on breast cancer isn't saying the other types of cancer don't matter. When someone is mourning over a death of a friend or a family member, you don't tell them that they shouldn't only be sad about only one person because there are so many other deaths to be sad about. Mourning someone you are close to doesn't imply that the deaths of others mean any less.  When people are saying \"black lives matter\", you shouldn't tell them they are wrong and that they should be saying \"all lives matter\".  Trying to shed light about the inequality black people face doesn't mean that other people don't face inequality too.  So, when Paris is affected like this and people are trying to show their support, stop telling them that they shouldn't show their support since there are other places that have been affected too. Let people acknowledge the event out of respect even if just changing a profile picture seems trivial. The intentions are good.",

I'd like to think that I'm changed now and I'm sure that most people would be satisfied that I had recognized what I was doing wrong and was making active efforts to change my behaviour and be more welcoming, but it bothers me that the nights I spent thinking about what I believed in and trying to be supportive of all people were not enough.",

It encourages people to see themselves as made of glass, subject to shattering on one misplaced rock.

The roaring laughter that ensues, is not only confusing, but painful to me because I feel that this joke hugely undermines the progress MIT has made towards racial inclusion. \n\nI'm not the best at discussing whats racist and whats not--I find my emotions usually get the best of me in these conversations. In the face of these issues, I usually just shrug my shoulders and learn to live with the harm. I'm not trying to impose on his freedom of speech, I just am fearful of what harm this might propagate when you have a very admired professor at a world class institution showing his students that there is no harm caused when making jokes like this.\n\nI almost want to post a link of the joke here (its on OCW and youtube, which is how I suspect he makes the same joke every year), but I'm not sure if it would do any good to publicly shame him and have people comment on his specific word use or debate whether or not what he said was actually harmful. But to me, when someone makes a joke where the punchline is based on the western born stereotype that \"all asians look the same\" , well that brings up a lot of pain, especially if this person is well respected in a community that students of color are trying to thrive in.\n\nIts been a year now, and these memories and this pain still resurfaces whenever conversations of race come up in the news. These videos are still on youtube. And he'll probably make the same joke again this year. I'm looking for some closure or a solution but its not the easiest to talk to people who demand to be convinced with whatever they deem to be logical when the harm is a very obvious experience for me.",

It's always something to do with black vs white when in reality there are other racial minority groups out there that are often forgotten in discussions surrounding racial tension. For example, cop beats up Asian senior, media does not play the race card nearly as much as when a black guy  gets beat up. Discourse surrounding racial discrimination and diversity needs to involve a diverse group of people rather than just a couple.",

Surely, the MIT community must recognize that these costumes make a mockery of me and my condition.  \n\nI've spoken to some other individuals who share my disability, and many of them expressed that they do not feel offended by these appropriative costumes.  Yet, their individual offense is neither necessary nor expected for recognizing offensiveness in general.  It doesn't matter whether they're offended, or even whether the majority of nearsighted individuals are offended.  The only thing that matters is that MIT must make a safe learning space for everyone - including me, and including other nearsighted people who are offended by these costumes, who I'm sure exist but just aren't vocal enough to speak up for themselves.  And as the most easily-offended nearsighted individual in this community, I get the privilege of deciding what is or isn't appropriate here.",

    "message": "#2571 Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do whatsoever with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This confession only has to do with two events I have experienced in the one semester I have been at MIT. I do not have a firm stance on the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. I feel that the complexities of the issue are beyond the scope of my knowledge and experiences. What I do understand a little better, though, is hate, and I am very much anti-hatred. I attribute my strong anti-hatred stance to my grandfather who amazingly escaped Germany during the Holocaust as a child. The rest of his family:mother, father, and older brother, though, could not escape and did not survive. Needless to say, this deeply impacted my grandfather. The most important way he influenced me was through his intolerance for hatred. He taught me that hatred is ignorant and could have a devastating impact if not kept in check. This leads me to two events that, although not unheard of, are very alarming and should not be occurring- especially at MIT. The first occurred a couple weeks ago during office hours. I sat down in an empty chair next to a girl whom I had not seen before. This girl was wearing a hijab. Naturally, I have no idea if she is Palestinian, simply anti-Israel, or what her views are, and quite frankly I could not care less. She's a student at MIT, like me, and she is here to learn, like me. She looked at me, and I smiled (even though the socially-awkward side of me panicked as it does whenever someone looks at me and I had to confirm to myself that my breath didn't smell and that I did shower that day). I did notice, though, that her eyes lingered on the Star of David necklace I was wearing. Without hesitation, she picked up her notes and sat away from me. Obviously, I do not know what she was thinking and maybe she simply could see better further back in the classroom. I did not let this bother me, though if you're reading this, I am sorry if I offended you. The second, more concerning event, happened before the \"Israeli Impunity and the Palestinian Reality\" event. Although I do not agree with the angry and perhaps hateful undertones of this event, I do support free speech and I am happy that students and faculty who are anti-Israel feel safe enough to voice their opinions. I was walking down the Infinite prior to the event; I saw a massive line of people and had no idea what was going on. I asked someone what was going on, and she said \"A talk by Dr. Chomsky on the injustices from bloodthirsty Jews\". As she was saying this, the person she was with looked at my Star of David necklace and then proceeded to say something in Arabic to the woman I was speaking with. The woman then proceeded to loudly and angrily exclaim that I was \"venomous\" and a \"disgusting murderer\" to which others in line turned to us. I was so alarmed and taken aback that I quickly walked away. I even felt unsafe to walk back to my dorm alone later that evening. I do not know whether these people were MIT affiliated or not. I do not feel that students should be censored in their political beliefs. I feel censorship can create an environment that could be deemed unsafe to students. What I do believe, though, is that people should be weary of when their beliefs transform into hatred. I am not Israeli nor do I have a strong opinion on the situation, and I have not even been to Israel. Yet, due to my cultural and religious identity I was verbally attacked in front of many people. I have not been here for a full semester, yet I have already experienced this hatred. I feel unsafe to wear my Star of David necklace that I have been wearing for years let alone discuss this matter. We are all students- most is not all of whom have played no role in this conflict. All student groups should be tolerant of each other's beliefs even if there is disagreement. But no student should be subject to personal discrimination and no student should ever feel that their safety is threatened.",

(Am 21+) . In my experience, I have met two types of girls.\n\n1) The white, asian [including Indians of course], or black girl who is insecure or probably lacks exposure and refuses to dance with any black male. I make this conclusion because I see them dancing with another  non-black male immediately after they turn down dancing with me. And repeat this disgusting behaviour throughout the party. I actually try to watch to see if I can prove myself wrong. Unfortunately, they prove me right every fucking time.\n\n2)  The ones who understand that a party is just a party and are willing to dance with anyone who can prove that they got moves.\n\nNow, if you belong to group two, clap for yourself. Those who belong to group one however, should check themselves or their prejudices. Do you prefer dancing with non-black males to black males? Why?...\nDo you understand that this behaviour could have a racist undertone? If you act this way because of what the media perpetuates, check yourself. Relax and have fun. Parties are supposed to be fun and not a space to bring whatever racist tendencies you have. \n\nThis post about discrimination also rings true for black women and online dating as well... but I won't delve into that for sake of brevity.\n\nI feel like this part of the world is overly obsessed with unfounded assumptions about races to the point where communities at schools like MIT and other schools around the Boston area are so segmented. Lets chill and have fun people, We share more in common than our differences to be honest...\n\n***ends rant",

From this perspective it is no wonder that science has not been able to arrive at a successful model for turbulence.

I haven't done well, nor am I currently doing well, in many of my classes. My advisor probably thinks I'm a piece of shit. I think I'm a piece of shit. I think I'm a dumb, ugly, unmotivated, boring, socially awkward dysfunctional piece of shit. That's what goes through my head, constantly.\n\nI have issues... my biggest one is that I'm AFRAID of people. Paralyzingly afraid of people. Always worried about what people think of me, always fearing I'm being watched and judged in public. I have a huge social anxiety problem. And it's cause I hate myself and have no confidence. It's probably why I never reach out to people for new friends or jobs.\n\nI'm tired of spending entire weekends in my room, only going out for bathroom breaks and to get dinner in a green box. I'm tired of spending hours on a pset failing to make any real progress. I'm tired of struggling in office hours, hearing people say they get it and it all makes sense now when I'm still confused, probably on a problem before the one they just got. I'm tired of not being able to get help when I feel this way because I can't talk properly to whoever comes to help me, in excruciating discomfort and fear that they and whoever else is overhearing will probably think I'm a dumbass.\n\nI'll never deliberately kill myself. I'm too scared of the possibility of hell, and I don't want to put my family through the grief. But I feel trapped in my inhibitions. I have to change something. But I'm not going to S^3 or mental health to do it, cause that's more people, and they'll probably just kick me out. Sorry to add another sad confession on here.",

Admitting the fact that racial proportion at MIT is an outcome of a fair competition based on SAT scores and other objective criteria and hence concluding that certain groups should just merely study harder is racist. Admitting the fact that yes, walking home too late at night (2am), I feel more scared about one racial group representative compared to another, just based on MIT criminal bulletin announcements racial stats is racist. \nWTF? \n\nI come from a country with multiple ethnicities with significant differences between each other. Acknowledgment these differences publicly in the form statements above and jokes is OK, since people there seem to have objectivity sense and sense of humor. This calm attitude seems to be based on the fact that no ethnic group feels endangered and hence takes these statements/jokes seriously. Wonder why here there is so much reaction here.",

A lot of people are rightly worried about police officers in school with children. The reason so many schools do it is that lawsuit threats make it very difficult for them to enforce discipline. Any wrong gesture or accidental mark left while physically dragging a disruptive student away could lead to criminal charges for the teacher and the school. Police officers are trained how to do this properly, have experience, and can do it with minimal legal threat. If you really want to get police officers out of schools support tort reform so teachers can safely grab students who are fighting or being wildly disruptive in class.",

    "message": "#2343 After being at MiT for a couple of years I've had a lot experiences that have redefined my self-identity as an academic and a person. We've all struggled here-okay *most* of us for one reason or another. We've all questioned ourselves and the Institute for what it *claims* to offer.\n\nFor me personally, I've constantly struggled here. My freshman year I chalked it up to not having a strong technical background. I didn't take AP Chem or higher level biology and those were the classes I got my fifth week flags in. As I was getting adjusted to just how rigorous (read: how absolutely fucking ridiculous) MiT work can be, sophomore year came. Once again I was flogged by work. Now in my major I chalked up to never seeing the material before, but sophomore year I realized, just like most people realize sophomore year, that something is up. MIT\nmay be ranked one of the greatest schools in the world but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the quality of the teaching. \n\nSee, every homework assignment I've EVER gotten at MiT. I've had to google, I had to Wikipedia, I had to Internet. Every assignment required me to learn what ought to have been taught in class. The problems were never really elucidated by lecture. They just show where the hole is, and the homework throws you in. \nAfter a few years here I've gotten tired of it. When I see professors say \"you'll learn through the Pset\" I realize that's often a poor guise to cover their poor teaching. And as much as people may learn from really hard problems only loosely connected to the lecture, I don't. Relying on excessively hard problems to most of the value to your education is one size fits all solutions that fails to take into account people's differing learning styles or the fulfillment of the undergraduate experience. I learn from teachers. Not problems. Even if I did, with the constant rush to the next assignment or the next problem you don't have the time to dissect a problem for its moral of the story. Let's be honest, you  don't even have time to sleep here. \n\nNow say what you will about MiT needing to be \"rigorous\" or hard, but in reality, I've spent years here just googling. Now googling Isn't inherently a bad thing , but when I find other universities with far better notes and lectures than MiT-constantly-I have my doubts about the Institute. \nI have my doubts when I see all of us struggling to get by, when I see suicide after suicide, and realize we are some of the smartest people in the world. Yet, collectively we struggle here. Yes, we came here for a challenge and yes struggling is a great way to grow, but clearly the struggle here is an order of magnitude off.\n\nGreat researchers don't always make for great teachers. And yes, the idea of having the best in the world teach you sounds great...but I realize being taught by the best *teachers* in the world would be a helluva lot better.\n\nI'm just writing this because I feel others can relate and this sentiment should be voiced\n\n~Holla",

Some people will argue \"I don't even know them!\", but tell the truth. If they hadn't explicitly said they were contemplating, you wouldn't have tried to talk them out of it. Suicide is death. It's not bad or good. It's a choice that is made by people who don't have anything they think is worth living for. Why stop them? Why force them to be uncomfortable just so you're not?",

And this makes them feel awful but their friends tell them \"you are below average at a top university - you are still above average in a grand sense.\"  I also see this ALL the time in comments on this page.\n\nWhile this *may* be true (I don't 100% believe that, after all STEM !> humanities), it just seems to be a super weird thing to say.  Why is your \"confidence\" based on being better than other people?  Sometimes it is super annoying to work with another MIT student at a company because they often look their noses down at kids from other colleges and they refuse to learn from them.  Like stop.  Stop getting your self worth from being better than other people.  Sometimes you aren't the best.  And that's okay.\n\nI have an older sister who is a freaking prodigy so I had to learn this lesson super young.  I would sometimes say, \"she is really, really smart - she gets things faster than me.\"  And my friends and parents would be so concerned about my self-esteem when I said that.  I later had to explain to them that just because I knew I wasn't better at her at school or at music than her didn't mean I wasn't confident in myself.  A lot of people at my high school didn't see it that way.  They thought the way a lot of you guys think - they got their self-worth from being the best.  And they saw her as a threat.  They told her everyday that she was stupid and basically bullied her.  My sister to this day doesn't realize how smart she is, how she has the freaking Midas Touch all because a few self-conscious people couldn't stand the thought of not being the best.\n\nSo how do I get my confidence?  From the knowledge that everyday I am here, I get better than I was yesterday and I test *my* limits.  And my only competition is myself.",

Changing the track makes him responsible for the single death, and therefore a murderer. Is he responsible for the five deaths if he does nothing? If yes, then he is responsible for all deaths you could prevent but do nothing about. If not, he has no obligation to pull it.\n\nI think most here would say you should pull the lever. However, if you aren't trying to save as many lives as you can every second of every day when you have the possibility to save them, then you are in some sense responsible for all of those lives. Ignorance of how you can save someone is not an excuse, since you can always use time when you can't save someone to gather more information so that you can.\n\nI'm on the side where I think we should try to save as many people as possible. I also know that I'm not doing as much as I can to save people. Doing this burdens me with extreme guilt, because I recognize that I'm responsible for a large number of deaths. I completely understand and respect why someone wouldn't want to deal with the guilt of blood on their hands.\n\nThread for those interested:\nhttps://warosu.org/lit/thread/6026166",

    "message": "#2260 Having been here for a while, I feel as though MIT can be a pretty isolating place. Whether this manifests itself in the form of a small unchanging friend group or spending most hours alone, it seems fairly easy to fall out of touch with the MIT community at large. Maybe I'm out on a limb here, but it seems as though it's mostly through online avenues, like MIT confessions, and at the few class-wide events that some people, like me, are reminded of the fact that 4000+ other undergrads are going through the same experience, with its mix of highs and lows. A decent number of high schools where I am from used to have weekly assemblies of the student body. At the time, I took these for granted but in hindsight, it was nice and almost therapeutic to have a chance to talk to people whom I otherwise wouldn't have had an excuse to interact with. While it's college and I'm guessing people don't want to have \"assemblies\", it would be nice if there were more campus-wide events. Maybe a free food event in Lobby 10 every month open to all undergraduates? Maybe other people feel similarly and have better suggestions. I recognize that confessions is probably not the best place to propose something like this... yeah, sorry about that.",

    "message": "#2254 I've probably met 100s of ppl here now and am still yet to meet even one who isn't amazing in some way. And yet for a place with the most amazing people I've ever met, this place does a helluva impressive job of making literally everyone feel the exact opposite way. Here's why, and this next part is going to sound rough, but I hope you read on beyond for my explanation: The fact is that I do consider some people to be more amazing than others, I mean that's only natural. That doesn't change the fact that everyone I've met here is amazing, but simply reflects the fact that we all have our own ideas of amazing. For example, the most amazing person that I know based on my standards of amazing is someone who always seems insecure/scared/inadequate for not having the best scores/stats/accomplishments but never fails to check in on a friend, which is a trait which I consider important enough to make them my most amazing. Similarly I've heard ppl consider someone who's gotten '200 top company job offers' (Clarification: That's intentional exaggeration) to be the most amazing. The point is that we are all so amazing that I guarantee that someone out there considers us to be their most amazing friend/acquaintance. Yet we are also so competitive, hell, we needed to be to get here, that we drown out that voice that considers us amazing and hear all the voices that consider us well, at worst, less amazing. Remember this quote:\n\n\"You are the most amazing person I've ever had the privilege of meeting\" -Someone, perhaps your best friend, your significant other, or someone you'll meet in the future, but I have no doubt someone has or will think this about you, and listen to them cause they're the ones who are actually right. I mean they're calling you the best person out of 7.1 billion people, which means you're pretty fucking amazing.",

They either believe that working hard should lead to unconditional success, or they believe that one shouldn't have to work hard to get a fair lot in life. This page is a great example.

They keep asking, how can we pay for the all the infrastructure spending without raising middle class taxes? Fair question, it doesn't mean Sanders hasn't thought it through. It's simple, we borrow more money. The U.S government is not a business, we have no borrowing limits. And the best part is, since we are the superpower of the world, we can borrow from other nations non stop and if we can't make the payments, we just tell them to take a hike and default. They can't come seize our assets or do anything, they just have to take a loss. That's their problem, not ours. Then we just borrow more at a higher interest rate and more to pay the higher interest, wash, rinse, repeat.",

What neither said pointed out was that both their ideas suck. What I think we ought to do as a nation is address the fundamental causes of sky high health care prices which no plan addresses. For example, you cannot import drugs from other countries. You can get them so cheaply elsewhere, but it's illegal to get them here. Another problem is buying insurance. You can't buy across state lines. So each state insurer gets their own monopoly and doesn't have to compete. Democrats say the old system was capitalism out of control, Republicans say the new system is socialism out of control. It's crony-ism out of control. If we address these fundamental flaws, insurance will be irrelevant.",

I can only dream of being as smart as them but I feel like I've hit this barrier. What I get done in 5 hours, they get done in 1. And yeah you can say all the bullshit about how it doesn't matter how accomplished or smart you are and how no one really cares after MIT, but I can't help but compare, especially as it is right there in my face. I know that any success or failure is my own fault and being bitter about how fucking dumb I am is immature, but I can't help it. Sometimes after staying up late to finish a pset they've already finished 4 hours earlier, I just feel so disgusted with myself. And I know that there's all these study techniques and all these resources available, but really, how much does that help? And I am getting help from my friends, but I just ask them so many questions I'm just frustrated with how dumb I am, regardless of whether or not my friends care. They don't, they're so willing to help it makes me even more angry with how incompetent I am. I'm just a burden, and I don't know what to do with my life, and fuck I'm just a huge fuck-up.

All of the \"stomachaches\" and \"colds\" I made up when they ask me if I had gone to class. I want to tell them so badly, to apologize; but I just can't. I'm so afraid of what they would think of me, eve though I know what what they would say, that it wasn't my fault and they don't blame me. I do though, I blame myself. I'm guilty.",

I've yet to be able to think of a time where one would ever have to do anything without being able to consult notes, textbooks, etc. outside of the completely fabricated situation that is a closed book exam. I guess you wouldn't be able to look at your notes if you were stranded on a desert island or something, but I can't imagine that that's what we're being prepared for. Why do I have to waste so much time making sure I remember formulas, definitions, etc. out of fear that forgetting one small thing could leave me unable to do an entire problem when in real life I'd be able to just quickly look up anything I couldn't remember at the moment and continue on? The only argument I can see against open book exams is that students may just show up for the exams without learning the material, but I'd argue that if you can essentially teach yourself a subject and complete a 50 minute exam in 50 minutes and get a good grade then you deserve it.",

    "message": "#1924 Since I've been here I've felt a bit of culture shock here and there. But not with what I expected. I grew up in a poor family. My dad finished high-school and never went to college, my mom didn't even finish high-school. They had to work 12+ hour shifts 6 or 7 days a week at dead end jobs to support us. I escaped reality by throwing myself into academics and got here as a result. My friends here have been supportive of me but there have been times where we had to deal with different sets of thinking. For example, both my parents smoke, my older brothers also smoke, and they all smoke in the house we live in. When I casually mentioned to my friends that they wouldn't like my house since it smells of heavy tobacco they flipped out and asked how any parent could subject their child to it and told me that I was an \"abuse victim\". It took a very long, patient, explanation and I want to share it because I feel that a lot of the middle class and rich students here do not get it, quite frankly. Most poor people smoke and are now the majority of smokers. One big reason is poor people don't get weekends, or vacations to a beach house, or yacht club. For many of them, a cigarette is the only break they get. And some people say, well what about 20 - 40 years from now? When you are barely scrapping enough money to pay rent and put food on the table today, 20 years from now is as far from  your mind as it can be. And about smoking in front of me, first of all, second hand smoke isn't nearly as dangerous as smoking itself, and if you read the studies, (I have quite thoroughly.) they admit you have to be around it in an extremely concentrated manner for decades to have any tangible effect. What I had, a few family members who would have a couple smokes after dinner at the table, does not nearly qualify. Also, my parents were both raised by chain smoking parents themselves, so this to them is very normal. What I ask my fellow students is to please stop rushing to judge poor people for not following middle class and wealthy people in lock step, money makes a massive difference. And please don't call me an \"abuse victim\". To compare people smoking cigarettes in front of you to a parent physically harming their child is insulting to people who have had to deal with it.",

How else are we supposed to know how the kids from various districts are doing against one another without them? Teachers have every reason to game their own grades to make their own students look good. Giving every kid the exact same test and time limit is the only way we will actually know how the kids are doing. I hear people complain, \"oh teachers will have to teach to the test, we are not teaching critical thinking\". Yes we are. Life is about passing tests, we all passed tests to get in here, you have to pass tests to get a job, that's life, kids need to get that lesson. Most people don't use, and usually don't need critical thinking anyway. The real reason teachers are against it is because they don't want to face the music and have to take the chance that they might be exposed as incompetent and get fired. Also, nobody admits this, but they could actually turn down the standardized tests legally. All they have to do is turn down federal funding. But they won't do that, they like getting 165 days of paid vacation a year, fat pensions, fat insurance plans, and for the top ones, 6 figure salaries, more then their own school freedom.",

    "message": "#1877 When I got here as a freshman I had no social skills whatsoever. My parents pretty much locked me up with videos games a kid. Their reasoning was if I was around other kids they would get me hooked on drugs. Had my parents actually done any research on drug addiction they would have learned that social lives generally help people stay sober. So when I got here I couldn't hold a basic conversation with most people unless it was about schoolwork. I remember spending every night crying alone in the shower so my roommate wouldn't hear because I didn't know how to express myself or relate to him. Most people thought I was a lunatic or autistic, or some interesting combination of both. I slowly observed and learned how to do social skills with other people. My first two years here was a long painful series of poor interactions. I remember wanting to shout when people gave me odd looks, \"I'm trying to learn how to talk to you, I'm 10 years behind and I have to catch up, can you cut me some slack?!?!\" I slowly got better, made friends and even have a girlfriend now. They all actually make a point to help me be aware. So I want to let everyone else out there feeling like they can't learn to be normal with people, you can do it. It's going to hurt and be scary, but I promise with work and determination it gets better.",

Secular and atheist birthrates are the lowest, and well below sustainability. Fertility for atheist women is about 1.5 children, hardcore religious, 2.5 - 6 per woman! Meaning the next generation of atheists will be smaller. Meanwhile the hardcore religious have the highest birthrates of all. The amish, mormons, devout Catholics, evangicals, all breed like rabbits. In the last 20 years the amish population has TRIPLED from birthrates alone. Immigrants here also tend to be more religious. If this continues in a couple generations we will go from a nation making secular progress back to a religious hive on the level of a middle eastern nation. So I urge all my fellow atheists and secular members, please make a point to have more children and raise them atheists. A good number to be safe is 3 or 4 children per couple to insure atheist population growth. I'm terrified to live in a world full of religious fanatics in a couple generations.",

    "message": "#1825 Earlier I posted a confession about the level of sexual acts I have witnessed here. I want to anonymously address two comments there which addressed good points.\n\nOne asked if I felt that a womans value only came from her sexual history and willingness. The other asked why I was talking about the women and not the men involved. The reason I choose to address women is because I feel this is an issue that harms women the most. To the women here I will be completely honest with you. The harsh reality is, in our society you have very little power as a whole. Men hold most of it. Sex is one of the few areas you can say no to definitively. Power is the ability to say no. The second you give that up, you lose power. This is not going to change anytime soon. Men have sex for very different reasons then you do. Women for the most part see it as the beginning of developing an emotional bond. Men simply see it as a recreational activity. Sex may be an act of love and fun for women, but for men it's an act of power, control, recreation, and in some negative circumstances, violence. Men tend to get into relationships and marriage for regular guaranteed sex, not so much the emotional bonds that women get into relationships for.\n\nTo answer the question of the value of women, no a woman's intrinsic human value is not based on sexual history. Unfortunately for men, her value as a partner in a relationship is. And guilt tripping men trying to tell them to change millions of years of gut instinct is not going to help. What I am recommending to women is to wait for a committed relationship. You have to make your partner wait, treat you well, and value you, and work for you physically. People value scarcity. And the key to dealing with the power dynamic of sex is to get the guy to commit then get sex. That way even though you have submitted and relinquished sex, he has submitted and relinquished some of his freedom. That way even though you have given up the sexual power, he still respects you and treats you well.",

I'm pale, you can tell I'm part black when I grow my hair out but I tend to keep it short and everyone who doesn't know me assumes I'm a tan white guy, and usually they guess I'm Italian. When I applied my guidance counselor who was white tried to get me to put down black as my race. I pointed out that I look white and am mostly white so white made the most sense. He persisted and made the argument that I've had a \"tough time\" as a \"person of color\" in life, so I should do it to \"help ease the admissions process\". I'm from a rich Jewish long island suburb I've been very fortunate. So I want to say to all white people out there who I one of, black people are not your little pity cases. Doing someone a favor for no reason other then them being black is condescending. Stop trying to be a white savior. If you really want to help black people then stop trying to tell them what race they are and that they are victims. I'm not a victim, maybe some of my ancestors were, but I'm far from it, I'll pull myself up by my own bootstraps.",

He talked about coming here in the 60's and how back then you didn't even get into bed with most girls until you were married or you promised her marriage. The reason it concerns me is how I'm honestly not sure how a lot of guys are going to be able to have normal relationships with one woman after getting Caligula style acts from various women. I'll admit it was really hard for me to settle down with one girl now. Guys, it is honestly worth it, but you have to train yourself to enjoy it.",

    "message": "#1749 I switched academic advisors today. When I emailed my new advisor, I made a joke about my bad GPA, because my old advisor gave me shit for getting bad grades. (\"Anon, maybe you're just not smart enough to be here.\") My old advisor didn't want to have me because I made her look bad. \n\nMy new advisor replied that he's honestly excited to get to know me better. He said he was going to work with me to figure out how to survive MIT. He didn't care that my GPA is bad. This unexpected support and acceptance made me sit down and sob for the first time in months.\n\nI didn't know why I was crying at first, but then I realized it was just the relief that someone was finally NOT judging me for my grades. Everyone who has seen my academic record just assumes things about me, because after all, how can you get D's and still deserve to be at MIT?\n\nI realized that this is the first time in two years that I've felt like more than the sum of my GPA and academic achievements. That's how I know this is such a fucked up place. Somehow, the faculty and staff have lost humanity amidst psets and exams and grades. I even forgot that I'm more than a sum of my academic achievements. It's easy to say to each other \"oh, you are more than your grades,\" but when your professors and advisor and faculty and mentors don't echo the same message, that's when things get bad.\n\nThank God for this professor. To anyone else out there who feels like they're absolute shit because their academic record isn't perfect, you are SO MUCH MORE than grades and psets and exams and school. You are a complex, beautiful, amazing human being and you deserve to be treated that way. Please don't forget it <3",

A lot of people love me.  I have a lot to enjoy now and a lot to look forward to in the future.  But sometimes I feel like it's all worthless just because something small fucked up my whole day or my whole week.  And that little something tends to be connected to a larger problem in my life, like it's indicative of something I hate about myself and that I suspect other people hate.  At moments like these, I sometimes go on Amazon, search \"sleeping pills\", and debate buying a bunch just so I can have a stash if I ever decide to kill myself in the future.  It's not that I thoroughly hate myself.  It's just that sometimes I want to see what would happen if I really was gone forever.  How would my family take it, how would MIT take it, how would my friends take it, how would people in my dorm and especially my hallmates take it?  Honestly, I think there'd be a week at most of sadness and then people would move on, just like when the last couple of students who offed themselves.  So it's really not worth it.  Anyway, I just wanted to speak up anonymously.",

I thought it was the same for me too. I thought that they would stop by my door and ask why I haven't been to class for that long. I thought they would stop by to ask if I was ok, maybe give me a hug and tell me that everything would be ok. But they never did. And that's when I stopped giving a shit about them. I stopped caring and constantly trying to fit in. If you don't care about me, why would I care about you?\nNow I see them wear the wristband. And it bothers me so much to see how pretentious they are.

I started dealing with depression and self loathing about a year ago, though I've only been honest with myself about it for a much shorter time.\n\nI think what's different about this tragedy for me is that it no longer seems unattached and distant from my life. I don't know everything Matthew was going through, but I know how impossible it can seem to balance horribly difficult academics with family issues, self loathing, and loneliness in the mix. To lose Matthew like this feels like a bitter blow to everyone battling their personal demons, because there's no reason this may not have been me or any of us. \n\nPlease pay attention to one another. I don't care who you are; we aren't so different. We all need support and love and positivity wherever we can get it.\n\nRest in peace Matthew",

I then had him walk me home with it. \nNow he's gone back to his apartment and I'm wearing it while studying for finals.

Being a pet. Being entirely under someone else's control, not having my human life to worry about, just worrying about pleasing one person in a way that isn't measured in \"success\" for once. \nIt's a really damn good escape.  \nAlso, I love my boyfriend so much for putting up with all my quirks and insanity like this. Like... I don't think I could ever find another guy who'll be okay with putting a dog collar around my neck and whipping me with the leash lol.

But if you're only doing it just because she's female, you're reinforcing this idea that women are incapable of doing physical things like lifting a table.",

    "message": "#1579 I don't understand why MIT decided to remove Walter Lewin's videos from OCW. I understand that his actions are not good ones and should be punished, but I don't think it's right to remove the lectures of a great professor from a free website that's supposed to be a database of classes. Lewin's lectures have helped plenty of students around the world learn physics. Why is it that his mistakes have to deprive future students from learning? \n\nIs there no separation of the professor from the person? I get that MIT may not want to associate with him during these allegations, but I'm still bothered by the removal of a great resource because of the actions of the person. We're burning 'books' and removing an amazing way to learn and experience a subject because the author did a bad thing, and that scares me.",

    "message": "#1577 I'm a white girl only attracted to asian girls. I feel very comfortable being openly lesbian at MIT, and I'm very thankful for that. But I feel extremely uncomfortable discussing my specific racial attraction with anyone because it's 'textbook racist' behavior. There's always the assumption that you're some sort of exotic-seeking-yellow-fever-pervert. ALWAYS.\n\nI've made genuine efforts to be physically attracted to non-asian people but haven't been able to. I'm not sure I fully control that. I REALLY have tried. But my sexual attraction doesn't make any assumptions about your culture or dictate your social worth--it's pretty much based ONLY on what you look like. And apparently, I'm not attracted to non-asian faces. I don't understand why that's necessarily racist. On the other hand, no one thinks I'm sexist for only liking girls. \n\nYes, all my relationships have been with asian girls, but they've been meaningful and with people I loved, and saying that I dated them \"just because they were asian\" is like saying I dated them \"just because they were girls\". I only date people I can be attracted to--but that's not exactly shocking behavior.\n\nBut there's SO MUCH stigma against white people exclusively dating asian girls.  I don't know if I'll ever feel comfortable talking about this part of myself, even though I don't understand why it offends people. Why does it feel like all the orientation tolerance and openness at MIT extends only to a narrow range of \"socially acceptable\" sexual orientations? Doesn't that defeat the point?",

People have a right to self defense in this country.  If you go and assault a cop, as Michael Brown did, what do you expect will happen to you?  Now, it's too bad he killed him, not denying that.  But if you were a cop, and someone was punching you in the face and threatening your existence, wouldn't you also do what you had to do to protect yourself?",

Too often I hear reports of two people, who are both drunk, hooking up and then the girl suddenly proclaims to be the victim even though both parties gave their consent (even if under the influence).  Then the case becomes her word against his word and in our society now there is a presumption of guilt with the man. For example the Duke lacrosse scandal a couple years ago ruined several young men's lives even though it was later found that they were completely innocent, as the \"victim\" simply lied.  I believe that if found guilty the perpetrators should be punished severely and swiftly, but in a country based on a presumption of innocence, I think the overreaction to sexual assault accusations goes against this foundational American value.",

    "message": "#1508 Is anybody else really annoyed about how far just \"networking\" can get you? I grew up in a relatively poor family, and my parents weren't friends with anybody, and they also didn't know(and therefore never taught me) any of the American social courtesies. Like, I never ever said \"thank you\" to anyone until middle school, when people started pointing out how rude I was to not say certain things.  \n\nWhen I first started going to science camps in high school, I was really impressed with everyone and felt inferior to everyone. I met people who had already done research before, or who had done these science olympiads, or had built robots and stuff. But then I just kept hearing these recurring stories, like \"blah blah my parents knew this one guy and that's how I started research\" or \"blah blah my teacher got me started in this\" or even \"blah blah oh yeah my relative works in [insert college] admissions, so I'm not worried about getting in\" blah blah blah. Oh and also \"blah blah I found out about his camp because one of my friends went here.\" Lol I felt incredibly odd for being the only person who found camps by googling stuff with the keywords \"science\" and \"financial assistance.\" I don't think those people even realize how privileged they are. To have even the smallest bit of guidance from somebody, or a nudge onto a path of success, or the tiniest bit of assurance that your life will turn out fine even if you do one thing wrong-- those are HUGE privileges. \n\nI find it so weird that had I not started googling things that one night when I felt too exhausted to do work, or started applying to those camps on a whim, I probably never would have even known what a tiny bubble I had been living in, and about the countless opportunities that other people took for granted. I probably never would have applied to MIT. \n\nNow that I'm at MIT, I realize that I have become one of those privileged people, and that I have the opportunity to network if I so choose\u2014that some person would give something I say more consideration just because I go to MIT. And I hate the fact that door is open to me. I hate the fact that door is open to anyone. After so many years of living in fear of the future, and having no idea where my life was headed, I don't think I'll ever be comfortable accepting anything I didn't directly earn through grueling, hard work. I am afraid of who I would become if I let my successes become a crutch.",

    "message": "#1475 There's so much social pressure to be \"caring\" or \"empathetic\", but I don't understand it. Someone posted a while ago that they think their \"empathy is broken\", and I really feel the same - I knew Phoebe, but her death really, truly did not perturb me in the slightest. Sometimes I think that there's something wrong with me, and sometimes I think there's something wrong with the rest of the world, but I legitimately don't give a fuck about \"feelings\", \"honor\", \"empathy\" or other intangibles. \n\nThis doesn't mean I'm continuously rude or selfish - I know how society works and conscious play the game to get ahead. But every expression, word, and action is a deliberate, calculated move to achieve a goal, never a relatable reaction. Usually this is exhilarating - liberating - I feel like I'm in absolute control of my life and most of the world around me - I feel like I can effect virtually anything I choose just by coordinating the right sequence of moves in the game.\n\nBut other times it's crushing, lonely, and bland, as if I've beaten the game but am still trapped in the same campaign, over and over and over again. Sometimes I'm ridiculously paranoid about people's motives, envisioning elaborate cons that they're manipulating, but in the end I'm only dreaming, *wishing* that they were because then I wouldn't be the only one.\n\nUsually when I confide this to people, they'll smirk and nod, think I'm obsessed with Sherlock or Spock, and secretly lament that I've been so sheltered. When I do actually experience loss or [emotional stimulant], they say, I'll realize how foolish I am. Then they go back to their shallow little lives, splash around in their kiddie pool of friends and, if they're lucky or ambitious, make a few ripples of drama in society at large. Good for them.\n\nMaybe someday, something horribly tragic (or terribly good) will happen to me and I'll snap out of it, discover empathy, and cannonball into the kiddie pool myself. \nThe worst part is that I can't decide if I want that to happen or not.",

This is really sad for me, because I was really excited about returning to MIT this year and seeing all of my friends again. I compare myself as I am now - working like crazy, catching barely any sleep and just dying - to how happy I was 2 months ago, and it couldn't be more different. Plus my depression is returning and I'm barely making it through the day. I feel like I picked the wrong school because I ultimately believe that life here is meant to be about much more than your profession, and although I have the skills to make it here, I couldn't see a starker contrast between me and those people who enjoy working so much that they make it their lives here.

I'm that kid who always appears to be coasting and acing life, but if I say so everyone will hate me, so I just say I'm busy, just like everyone else. In reality I don't have any close friends and my life is pretty unsatisfying. I missed out on making a lot of close friendships my freshman year due to relationships and other things. I'm in a fucking sorority, but when I walk into a room full of my sisters, I realize that hardly any of them are really my friends. I say hi to some of them in the hallways and that's about it. Some of them look the other way when I walk past. I would disaffiliate, but I'm so close to the end now that it seems like a waste of years of dues money not to become a lifetime member. I get really happy and really sad every time I think about graduating because I'm so happy to get out of this place where I have no friends, but so sad because I expected to make the best friends of my life here. Yes, it's probably largely my fault for being bad at reaching out to people, but seriously? Not one person has noticed that I'm desperately lonely and have been since the start?",

I think I'm on the list, but I'm more afraid he's going to do a mass shooting.\nI have spoken to the police, they were instrumental in having him committed for 72+ hours in a special facility (instead of spending only 48 hours in the hospital). But he hasn't made any explicit threats, so no crime has been committed aside from maybe disturbing the peace.\nI can't believe this is happening in my life. I'm sitting here working on psets, as if there wasn't a person merely hours away who's locked up, violently deluded, and probably growing more and more angry with every passing minute.

I've had this connection to the Jewish experience and religion since I was 12 or 13.  It's just that I've only recently been able to figure out what it means and what to do with it.  I can't help that my timing sucks.  I can't help that I fell into an exhausted and dehydrated sleep Saturday night and had to stay up late because of it.  I can't help how scared and nervous I feel when I see people I know when I'm going to a synagogue.  I can't help that this semester feels harder than it should be because of the 18+ units spent researching this, going to services, and reflecting on where I want to go from here.  I can't help that I sometimes sit in my room and cry because the world has butchered and persecuted these people for so many centuries and for no reason.\nThis process is fucking hard, but I love what I've learned and who I've met and who I've become because of it.

Firstly, a Prof at MIT said that if you're at MIT, you must be doing something right. Also, if we step out of MIT, we can clearly see how much better our education here is compared to other schools. I know, coz I'm a grad student who did undergrads elsewhere. \nOne thought I really feel like sharing: if you keep failing at something,it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means that you're supposed to succeed at something else. A lot of us are bad at accepting failure. For example, not matter how much Stephen Hawking may want to be an athlete, the truth is he has to accept that he can't be and cherish his talent in Science.",

    "message": "#1389 So..the article \"Drunk female guests are the gravest threat to Fraternities\" has sparked a lot of conversation and anger.  And so has the response \"Fraternities are their own worst enemies, not Drunk Girls.\"  \n\nI'm going to be brutally honest.  I'm a girl, and I actually agreed with a lot of the things that Bill Frezza was talking about.  He went a little overboard on points, but in light of the LCA incident and the frat ban now and last year, he was probably a bit worked up about everything and said things he probably regrets.  \n\nOutside of MIT is a different story, but within our school, I believe that a lot of frats here really do try to follow the basic rules.  Yeah, they're going to have alcohol, but when it comes to the serious situations of rape and sexual assault, the fraternity as a whole is not going to encourage and support those kinds of behavior.  I think what Frezza was trying to say was that fraternities have control over themselves, but not their guests--and there's a larger consequence if something happens to a guest that is a female (which is a whole different topic).  There's a potential for a lot of misunderstandings that could blow up into things that could bring down the frat.  \n\nI'm not talking about sexual assault or rape cases. That's the fault of the person who committed those actions (but still not the fraternity as a whole).  I'm talking about people who are intoxicated who make poor decisions because of their state and end up hurting themselves and blaming the frat. Most of us have been to a frat party.  There's a lot of people to watch out for, and a situation like that is really hard to prevent.  And unfortunately, the situation is a lot worse if that accident happens to a girl rather than a guy.  Politically that's just how it is.  \n\nAnd let's be honest, the response article was a dramatic, exaggeration of the LCA situation.  \"an intoxicated girl 'danced out' a frat house window, thereby ruining the party.  I'm pretty sure the brothers, all the other frats, and the rest of campus took that more seriously than a party buzzkill.",

The truth is, you did things to me I had explicitly requested you not to do. Regardless of whether or not I slept with other people, this is bad. Although I don't care that much because it didn't end up resulting in pregnancy, I almost feel the responsibility to speak up/stand up for other women who may place more emotional/psychological value in sex. The reason I am keeping this secret in real life is purely for your sake, so if you keep that attitude up and piss me off more, maybe I WILL speak out. (and when I say, I don't care that much, I mean now that I know I'm not pregnant. The during the couple of weeks of absolute terror, I did care)\nNow, regarding cheating, the agreement was don't ask, don't tell, and pretend I'm yours. You asked and gave me no choice but to tell. I wouldn't have told you otherwise.",

Equality is not about going out on a crusade to even out how many wrongs each side has done. Let's take a classic example: just because you're a girl doesn't mean you should treat guys like shit. Just because someone hurt you doesn't mean you get to advocate for the person who looks the most like you because it's \"more likely\" that they were the one who got hurt. That shit is the reason feminist has devolved into a label I'd rather not have. And that's really, really sad, because so much could be done if we could all calm the fuck down.",

It was big and bold and impossible to avoid. I thought it was wasteful at first. Sure, they could have done something else, but any complaining about the blue ribbon tape is, I feel, quite unjustified. The only reason I see people complaining is because they are an environmental group; I am sad to see that the same people are not complaining about the yellow ribbon MIT Facilities puts up on Kresge nearly every week, in an absolutely futile attempt to keep the grass green. It is akin to criticizing them for putting up copious amounts of paper to broadcast their events, just like every single other student group on campus. Are we to restrict this group, that is fighting to combat global climate change, to solely forms of communication that in no way affect the environment? If you have to use a few trees, or use a few gallons of gas, in order to save billions of trees and human life as we know it, by all means, you have my blessing.\n\nThank you, Fossil Free MIT. I am not a member, but your display brought a great issue to light. Everyone is talking about it, and even if they are discussing it negatively, at least they are talking about it. Plus, you got a response from President Reif! Go you! Please continue to encourage people to divest from fossil fuels, and make the world a better place. And if you have to use a few yards of blue ribbon tape once every year, by all means, do so: I think the cause you are fighting for is a little bit bigger than a roll of blue ribbon tape.\n\nPeace.",

I don't want to go into detail but they made me feel like complete shit.  I thought that maybe my experience was just especially awful but when I talked to friends, they said that they had similar experiences at MIT Mental Health.  I found out later that working it out with my boyfriend's help (who actually cared about me) was a lot better.  Sure, going to MIT Health was a good first step (made me realize I had a problem), it didn't help my problem at ALL.\n\nSo maybe try MIT Medical but I would definitely suggest telling some you trust your problems.  Maybe a parent, a sister, a uncle, a good friend, anyone.  It's so much more helpful than telling someone who just wants to check off boxes to diagnose you and throw pills at you.",

    "message": "#1276 Despite being an environmentalist, I really don't agree with Fossil Free MIT. In particular, their decision to put a blue rope around campus is quite hypocritical and counter productive. Fossil Free MIT seeks to divest MIT away from fossil fuel and promote sustainability yet their blue ropes did just the opposite. \n1) Those blue ropes are mostly made out of petroleum, specifically polypropylene, which uses fossil fuels to produce and transport. \n2) The the extensive use of the tape is wasteful use of resource. If this was a PR stunt, very few people had the time to stop to actually read the text on the tape - most people viewed it as a construction caution tape. People probably viewed it as a nuisance than informative as it was spread all over the place and made our campus look aesthetically displeasing.\n3) The tape harms the environment. If Fossil Free MIT cared about sustainability, they should have realized that some of the tape they place came undone and flew away. Much like littering, those tape pieces now have the potential to get stuck around a bird's wing, chock a bird who accidentally swallows it, pollute the Charles River, etc. Considering that the tape was made from petroleum, it most likely will not biodegrade, leading to long term waste. \nIt is a shame that Fossil Free MIT cared more about their voice than their actions. Actions speak louder than words. Please don't harm the environment just so you can be heard.",

Decades of personal observation have shown me that those who try this technique tend to lose hope and become sleep-deprived, emotionless, heartless social outcasts much slower than the rest of us do here, even though you all will get to that at some point.

I just wanted to inspire you to believe that you are capable of overcoming any of the various difficulties I have designed to break your spirit, though in fact you never will.

Taking the extra time to introspect allows you to better visualize your future, and it often lets you explore doors to amazing possibilities you might never have considered otherwise. To all my fellow peers who have ever felt hopelessly behind or incompetent in TFP in any way, I encourage you to treat your MIT experience (and beyond) not as a race, but as a marathon. It's been said before, but truly each and every one of you is here for a reason-- not just for what you've accomplished, but for your potential.

I think we all have a right to be upset about what happened a year ago yesterday. The bombings happened right across the river in the city we currently live in. Of course we're going to want to help out as much as we can; we feel like we relate to this incident more. Sure, there have been situations overseas that have led to more casualties, but god damn man, just because we don't personally know victims of the bombings doesn't mean we aren't #BostonStrong. Get your head out of your ass and let us, as a school and as a city, come together. Don't tell us what to do.\n\nThe 'confession' is posted below. As always, feel free to comment/debate. \n\nPersonally, the bombings last year (since they happened 20 minutes after I left the finish line where I was watching the marathon), made me realize that life is precious and short, and that I shouldn't take anything for granted. So, excuse me for wanting to be #BostonStrong.\n\nAlso, don't talk shit about this amazing country we live in. Merica.\n\n#1233 'Can we take a moment to see why the world hates America so much?\n\n4 people died. Dozens were injured. #BostonStrong was the most tweeted hashtag for weeks after the event. The One Fund raised over $100 million to support the victims. New Balance is advertising their new \"Boston\" shoes. Someone at Wellesley wrote a song commemorating the occasion, and 100 people sang it on the radio.\n\nNow imagine watching all this from the point of view of a man in Syria who just lost his home and family in a bombing. Or from the POV of a Sudanese boy whose arm was cut off via machete by rebel forces. Or from the POV of a human trafficking victim who gets raped every day. Or from the POV of a Vietnamese slave working in triple digit weather building skyscrapers in Dubai.\n\nAnd not to mention: most MIT kids don't even know a victim of the bombings. Most of you sat at home watching the TV while police led a wild goose chase for 2 small time terrorists. Please tell me how you are #BostonStrong.\n\nTragedies happen every day. What happened to quiet resilience? What happened to keeping your head down and moving on with life when bad things happen?\n\nAmericans are the best in the world at blowing smoke up their own arses. But hey, whatever makes you feel important. #BostonStrong #BornInTheUSA'",

My logic is that maybe if they're not completely surrounded by misery and psets and exams looming on the horizon, they'll feel a little better and be happier/more productive.\nBut when I crack, I really REALLY crack.  I get sad, I cry a little, I hate everything, I isolate myself or calmly tell people I can't avoid that I just don't want to see anyone right now.  The people I hold close to me are suddenly fucking annoying.  I get jealous of people who are more hosed because I feel like they're smarter than me for taking harder classes, and I get jealous of people who are less hosed than me because they can handle their shit better than I can.  The only person who's seen me crack is someone who doesn't even go here and is in another country right now but still loves me to death.  I'm afraid of cracking again and not having anyone to help me through it when I need someone.",

It's Ivy day, and my friends are all getting into most of the schools they applied to, but I've only been rejected. I've even gotten rejected from a couple schools that are supposed to be much less selective than MIT. \n\nHonestly, I'm not as smart as my friends. I don't try as hard on every little assignment. I'm even having trouble coherently writing this post. I don't feel like I deserve to be admitted. It feels like all my (very few) accomplishments are hollow. Lots of my A's were borderline and probably should have been B's, all I really did was dink around in my oh-so desirable lab job, and I'm not even that good at the sport I was recruited for. And now that some of my friends admitted to MIT are treating it like its nothing, just another option they are hardly considering, and that I was only admitted because I'm an athlete\u2026 I don't know what to think. \n\nEveryone has been talking about imposter syndrome and that we all belong here for a reason. I feel like whatever MIT thinks my reason is, whether it is athletics or extracurricular activities or academics, I still don't deserve to be at a place as great as MIT.",

Depression doesn't just go away after a few days people.  \"Being there\" may sound like a romantic concept at the time (it will be just like the movies, a best friend holding a best friend's hand as they go through a tough night) but it may encompass a year of watching them slowly make strides and slip and fall.  It's been a little over a year for me.  \n\nAnd just when I started to think I trust you, you pulled the rug.  I don't blame you though.  Everyone can only take so much.",

It's nothing personal - it's just that I'm doing everything I need to to maximize the material I learn when I am in study mode. I think the problem is me - I've always been the kind of student who needs to repeat a problem -10 extra times before I get it. I was the slowest student in my high school AP classes and I feel like I'm still the slowest student here. It's disheartening to watch all your other friends understand it the first or second time around, but it's something I've grown to accept. Also, seeing reactions or patterns in my classes isn't intuitive to me as professors often say. Perhaps, I do understand the reactions/patterns/math/etc.; I'll feel proud of myself, and I'll feel confident about taking that test. But if that professor places it on the test with an extra (by extra I mean huge) twist, you can bet your dog biscuits I will not see it - I'll try to, but I won't think of it there on the spot. \nIt's not ignorance. \nIt's not laziness. \nIt's not about studying smart - I'm sure that benefits a lot of other people. \nNo, I know the problem is me and that's alright.",

And I know you feel hated on because everyone says you get special treatment and all minorities are oppressed because of it, and they're totally milking it and blah blah blah.\nBut just imagine--with all the hardships that EVERYONE has to go through, it would be nice for people of color to not get judged simply for being of color. To not be doubted on a daily basis about their intellectual ability because \"they're only here because of affirmative action.\" It would be nice to not get looked at funny when you go to a store and are followed around by (usually white) employees because not being white apparently makes you a shoplifter. It'd be nice to walk down a street without people clutching their purses or children closer, or CROSSING THE FUCKING STREET because they're scared to pass you because you're not white so you MUST be a criminal. It would be nice to not have to worry about your parents being discriminated against and not realizing it because you're not there to understand when someone throws racial slurs at them and since they don't understand because English just happens to be a bitchy language to learn, all they can do is smile and greet them. Or to be worried that you're not there to translate your younger siblings' school papers to them so they don't always know what's going on. Is it really too much to ask to be treated fairly? I mean, look at what society is calling people of color. MINORITIES. They are automatically labeled as something INFERIOR. \nSo please. If you're gonna go complaining because you're always seen as just another good citizen while people of color are constantly being accused of being criminals of the world for not having been born white, or because on top of all your other problems you AT LEAST have to deal with people seeing you as THE MINORITY--go do it with other privileged human beings and stop asking the people that are currently on the short end of the stick to feel sorry for you. And if you're trolling, go make yourself useful and do something nice for people for a change. The world is fucked up enough without you making people's lives even more annoying to deal with.\n\nP.S. Also, FYI, that's only SOME of the shit a Latina has to go through. So fuck off.\n\nP.S.S. Can we please all stop being racist now and go back to posting confessions about having sex in random places and stuff? MIT is bitchy enough without this bullshit and I like seeing how creative people can be (you know, regardless of their race).",

How I could be in such close proximity to someone who could be so special to me. How somewhere in that room I could find love.\n\nBut I don't know anybody. We may mostly all be freshmen but I feel like I know only 5% of my class, if even. And somewhere out there is somebody who would bring so much beauty to my life, someone whom I've yet to meet.\n\nI try to meet new people. I try to go to social events (though I detest parties), and I try to talk to people, but it's so hard. When I talk to someone new, 98% of the time I will never talk to them again. I may have an awesome conversation with someone (guy or girl) for twenty minutes, but if anyone asks for contact information, it's me, and then it's awkward, and then nothing ever comes from that. It seems impossible to truly get to know anyone new. I also feel kind of far from where most interactions happen because of my dorm's location, so 90% of the people I know are from my dorm. I like the people I know but I don't even have a close friend yet, and I feel stuck, like I've already met pretty much everyone I'm going to meet throughout my entire time here.\n\nI'm not unhappy, I guess, and I know I don't /need/ love or closer friends, but it's so strange to think that theoretically, every day, I could be passing by in the halls a person that in an alternate universe, if things had happened a bit differently, I would love so much.",

He likes spending time with me too, but he never texts first, etc. nor asks me to hang out with him. I can guess that he doesn't feel the same about me, but I still want to ask him out.

I'm afraid to share my opinions without being shunned or thought of as a bigot.  It's super frustrating to hear somebody give their point of view and assume I agree when I'm too afraid to speak up.  Why are the most \"tolerant\" people just as intimidating as the \"intolerant\" ones?",

There was too much hate in their speech at times. The sad thing about politicians as I keep noticing from one country to another, is that they don't seem to care much about humanity. their values are very close to only one community, not caring about the other communities- I mean, that's not a bad thing, as long as you remind your community that there is a bigger picture as well, and that all humans are worthy of your love. We are all one. This whole world, the people everywhere are all good, kind people. Some are misled, instead of hating them and giving way to hate, why don't we start trying to fix them. Teaching them to love. Not hating them back and judging them and not giving them second chances.\nIt's not Boston ONE. It's humans ONE (humans in Boston in our case)- it was the love for people that made those brave Bostonians reach out and help during that catastrophe, it was not the fact that they had to help the Bostonians. Tell me, did those brave Boston men and women ask \"Oh, where are you from? So we know if we should help you or not?\". and it is sad that people at power don't understand it- or even worse, they don't care as long as it helps them politically. Saying things that do not inspire love or care for other people, they don't understand that the majority might just be carried away in those feeling of hate towards some other miserable person that for who-knows-what reasons has been brainwashed and misled into the hate and destruction. Our enemies are Hate and Destruction. Not people. I totally agree with both #440 and #437. And I'm glad looking at some many people think this way. I'm really glad. I love all of you open-minded, kind-hearted intelligent peeps  Keep loving! We CAN make this world a better place!\"",
