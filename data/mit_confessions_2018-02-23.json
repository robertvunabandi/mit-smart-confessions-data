I hate it when they put white people in black roles and vice versa; when you change the race of the actor or the character, you're just saying that the race's identity has no value. Black Panther was an amazing example of how great a story is when you have black actors in black roles. e.g. I'm not saying that we can't have a black James Bond, but just don't call him James Bond. Give him his own back story that celebrates his own identity.
