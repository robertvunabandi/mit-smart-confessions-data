It really gave me the gumption and backbone to just do what I wanted with my ECs and not be too highstrung with the profiles and stats and all that. My essays are pretty honest and from the heart. All that's left is to press the submit button and let the folks in admissions handle the rest. \n\nEven if I get rejected, it'll be fine.
