I have the feeling that I attract guys and people in general, but they somehow feel intimidated by me which makes me instantly act as if they were inferior to me. I am then too proud to make any move that could hint I am interested. Arguably enough, I grew up in Eastern Europe where they teach you \"moral values\" and where they cultivate your hubris as something honourable. I wish guys were more daring with me, more challenging in conversations, but they seem only interested in jumping your bones rather than fucking my mind.", "comments": 13, "reactions": {"like": 40, "love": 2, "wow": 1, "haha": 6, "sorry": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 17481, "page_engaged_users": 97, "page_views": 329, "page_consumption": 106}}, {"created_time": "2017-05-18T07:42:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1422218607847182", "message": "#9440 I helped my best friend hook up with the my ex even though I wasn't over her and I don't know why", "comments": 6, "reactions": {"like": 30, "love": 1, "wow": 3, "haha": 1, "sorry": 17}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 17481, "page_engaged_users": 97, "page_views": 329, "page_consumption": 106}}, {"created_time": "2017-05-18T07:41:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1422217361180640", "message": "#9436 This feels like the second half of senior year in high school, I'm unmotivated to do any work whatsoever, but its different because I'm dying in all of my classes.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 81, "love": 4, "sorry": 13, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 17481, "page_engaged_users": 97, "page_views": 329, "page_consumption": 106}}, {"created_time": "2017-05-18T07:41:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1422218161180560", "message": "#9437 I ordered a pizza from Domino's and freaked out because it came with no toppings or cheese, just bread.
