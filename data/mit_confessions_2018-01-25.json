    "message": "#12015 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Mass Tech. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical campus \"\"hacking\"\" culture most of the jokes will go over a typical student's head. There's also the movement's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - Mass Tech's personal philosophy draws heavily from dormspam flame wars, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Mass Tech truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mass Tech's existencial catchphrase \"\"We Are Mass Tech,\"\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Mass Tech banner unfolds itself over Lobby 7. What fools... how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Mass Tech t-shirt. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",

    "message": "#12000 Someone please correct me and let me know where I'm misinformed. I know I'm missing something.\n\nI feel like some parts of MIT's AI startup movement are misguided (and that MIT isn't doing a proper job of teaching ML and educating aspiring AI entrepreneurs). I say this for 2 reasons: \n\n1. MIT AI/Machine Learning courses are either very theoretical (focusing on the math / nitty-gritty of certain ML algorithms) or too broad (they try to cover a ton of ML concepts / essentially take you on a journey through how ML progressed). In other words, their primary focus is on understanding models, not building them.  \n\n2. Building your own ML models is another challenge in and of itself, but to (over)simplify things, it boils down down compiling a large (possibly unwieldy) dataset and then applying matrix multiplications, loss functions, and backpropping. Compiling the dataset takes a huge amount of time (not to mention figuring out how to label them), and then tinkering a model to \"do well\" on whatever the initial goal was, then going back and forth between the two, takes even longer. Not to mention that much of it is resource intensive and will have to be done on AWS. \n\nMIT clearly believes in AI / Machine Learning (just based on the number of new courses and the IBM partnership). My concern is that MIT may be  overemphasizing the wrong parts, focusing more on the ML models rather than the process of building everything (dataset and model) from scratch. (This could go into a whole other debate on whether its student's jobs to learn these things for themselves / whether internships should cover those aspects, but I'd like to focus more on how MIT is approaching ML).  \n\nBasically, TLDR, MIT's way of teaching machine learning provides a good foundation for building 1-shot machine learning tools, not machine learning startups.",
