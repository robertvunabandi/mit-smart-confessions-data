    "message": "#3350 Anne McCants is one of the most repulsive creatures I've ever had to interact with at MIT. She is completely unfit to be a housemaster or role model for students, and has been trying to impose her own belief system on the Burton Conner dorm by suppressing student culture. She is completely out of touch with the students she claims to serve, refuses to listen to their concerns, and fails to advocate for their well-being. She is a source of pain, stress, and frustration for students, and actively goes out of her way to prevent socialization betweenus by false accusations, appealing minor complaints to higher administration, and ignoring student opinions about student life in the dorm. MIT should sack this cunt.",

Sure I have happy moments and even happy days, but I'm not sure I've ever been able to say with conviction that I am happy in any long term sense. It seems like others feel this way too, so I ask, in all seriousness, does anyone reading this feel truly happy?
