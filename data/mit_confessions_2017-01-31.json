I've had really bad luck during high school and up to this point in my college career trying to find something serious but instead get myself involved with really socially awkward guys who don't know what they're doing, fuckbois who only give a shit about fucking me for a night, or emotionally needy guys. Yeah, I get it, we're living in a hook up culture. But I feel like you can learn more out of a relationship. And I'm not going to do something I don't wanna do just because it's \"college.\" If I have to wait years to find a boyfriend, then so be it.
