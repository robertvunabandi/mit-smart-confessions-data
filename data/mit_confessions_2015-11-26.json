Either aboutsomehow \"accidentally\" getting back with you once again and putting myself into reliving the pain, or a combination of that and the last few non verbal encounters we had.  I'll get over it eventually, they're just subconscious remnants of trauma. I just really hope you learned for your next relationship.  Never treat someone how you treated me.  Your last message makes me hope you did learn.  You are an amazing person and even though I don't love you anymore I do remember why I loved you and I hope you can share that with someone else.  \n\nI want to say the following because there's a chance it can help someone else:  No relationship is worth emotional/physical abuse. Emotional abuse is very real, because there was no physical damage I used to think it wasn't real/wasn't really affecting me. But it was. When I see him now I get so scared, but not for my physical safety.  I never thought this was possible, a conditioned fear reaction without (much) physical cause. I don't care how much you love them, how good things are usually, how much it feels like you can never love someone as much as you love them.  Do not let them hold you hostage by your love.  If they threaten to break up with you over something absurd in order to control you, let them.  Call theyre bluff, youll see its almost always a bluff.  If they threaten to break up with you, let them and say goodbye. Dont take them back, especially not if this happens repeatedly.  If they say, \"if you really loved me then [insert something they want you to do/not do]\", realize there's a big chance they are trying to manipulate/control you.  Never let someone try to invalidate your emotions or tell you they are wrong/not real.  If you repeatedly argue with them about the same things, and its always them attacking you and you defending yourself, its probably not going to change.  You'll make up, things will seem fine, and it will happen again.  Leave them.  Even if it seems like you can't survive without them, you can, you will adapt and grow and you will be so much stronger and happier because of it.  Losing them will open room up in your life for so much more.  Never let fear control you.  \n\nIf you are ever confused or unsure about how you are being treated in a relationship, please ask for help, go to VPR.  They can help you figure out what's going on, which is usually  really difficult if you are blinded by love.  Emotional abuse is so hard to deal with alone because even if you know youre in the right, having to always defend yourself really does affect you in subtle ways and gives them control over you.  Literally the person I talked to at VPR helped me immensely, even though no one has ever been able to help me work through something before in my life. You are strong, you will adapt, and you are worth so much more.\n\n-2924", "comments": 0, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 0, "page_engaged_users": 0, "page_views": 0, "page_consumption": 0}}, {"created_time": "2015-11-26T00:14:26+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_975173772551670", "message": "#2978 I appreciate everyone who shared about their abusive relationships.
