Focusing on breast cancer isn't saying the other types of cancer don't matter. When someone is mourning over a death of a friend or a family member, you don't tell them that they shouldn't only be sad about only one person because there are so many other deaths to be sad about. Mourning someone you are close to doesn't imply that the deaths of others mean any less.  When people are saying \"black lives matter\", you shouldn't tell them they are wrong and that they should be saying \"all lives matter\".  Trying to shed light about the inequality black people face doesn't mean that other people don't face inequality too.  So, when Paris is affected like this and people are trying to show their support, stop telling them that they shouldn't show their support since there are other places that have been affected too. Let people acknowledge the event out of respect even if just changing a profile picture seems trivial.
