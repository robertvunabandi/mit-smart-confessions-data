Of course I am happy for them and I cheer them on but I just want to feel some of that happiness/success for myself as well. I cheer on these people all the time but never have anyone do the same for me even once. And it's not that I cheer others on because I expect the same in return, but because I really do believe in them. I guess people don't bother with me because I cheer on others so much that they think I cheer on myself? I've gotten to the point where I am unfollowing people on social media and avoiding them in real life to stop being constantly reminded of how inadequate and useless I am.
