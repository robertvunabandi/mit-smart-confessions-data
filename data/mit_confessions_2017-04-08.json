Since CPW is coming up, I thought it\u2019d be good to dispel some \u201chelpful advice\u201d I got as a prefrosh and freshman.  1. \u201cGPA doesn\u2019t matter\u201d - o fuck off. Ok, you don\u2019t need straight A\u2019s or even straight B\u2019s to survive. Hell, you don\u2019t even need to go to college. But know that employers will judge the hell outta you if you have a shit GPA and mediocre resume. Why the hell would classes be graded if GPA didn\u2019t matter.  2. \u201cAt MIT, we have the November Rule\u201d - lolwut. Only tourists believe this shit.  3. \u201cBroo party cuz its PNR\u201d \u2013 have fun while you can and get C\u2019s in classes that you give no fucks about.
