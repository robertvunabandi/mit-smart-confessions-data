I\u2019m posting on here because I\u2019m looking for real answers since I know that a lot of MIT students support the movement\u2014 please don\u2019t hate on me if I come off the wrong way. I promise I don\u2019t mean to say anything here on a degrading way :(\n\nAnyways, on with the question. I\u2019m confused about gender identity. I understand that some people may feel as if they had been born with the wrong genitals and want to change over to the other sex. However, when someone says that they have a different gender identity but don\u2019t necessarily feel the need or want to change their genitals. For example, if someone who is a male by sex at birth proclaims that he identifies as a female, then are they just stating that they like to partake in \u201cfemale\u201d activities such as putting on make up, liking \u201cgirlish\u201d colors, and \u201cspeaking\u201d like a girl? I guess what I\u2019m asking is: do they find partaking in activities that are generally associated with female behavior fulfilling?\n\nIf this is the case, then why can\u2019t we just consider (sorry if this is politically incorrect) \u201chim\u201d a male that just likes to partake in female activities? After all, if gender is a social construct, what do people have to gain by becoming \u201ctransgender (in this sense)?\u201d Isn\u2019t that in some ways enforcing the very gender roles that the left is trying so hard to get rid of?\n\nTLDR; I understand the feelings of those who feel as if they have been born with the wrong sexual organs at birth. But when people talk about having a different gender identity or even having a fluid gender, what does that mean? Do they just like the social aspects of a certain \u201cgender,\u201d even though gender is just supposed to be a social construct and gender roles in an ideal world shouldn\u2019t exist according to the left? Please don\u2019t hate on me :(", "comments": 3, "reactions": {"like": 17, "love": 2}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 24364, "page_engaged_users": 1059, "page_views": 1261, "page_consumption": 3351}}]
