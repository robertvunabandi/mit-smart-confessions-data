I believe I have misinterpreted your friendship and I'm broken hearted by it. I must say there are many things about you that make you stand out from any other girls I have met. I don't know where you get that spirit, energy and love for life. I enjoy how you bring laughter and great conversation to the table. As difficult as it is to write, only because I care for you, as a friend I suggest you focus on the serious candidates and stop spreading yourself thinly amongst the amount of guy friends that you have. I guarantee you these lucky guys who have an opportunity to call you theirs have mixed emotions with your actions towards all your other friends. Guys are guys, they like to talk and would not like for your rep to be attacked. I know you are not about that one bit, and you deserve to be respected, which I would totally do if you had me, but as a friend I would like for you to be more cautious. Trust me, the guy friends you have now will continue  to be your friends because you're you. I for one are one of those friends. Maybe someday you will see me in the same way I see you. If your perspective crushes don't see what a diamond you are, they are absolute tomfools. I for sure see the radiant light that you emit. Only a few days left before you leave and it sucks you won't be around for six weeks, but I can't wait to hear about your travels to San Diego and Israel. I'll anxiously be awaiting your return.", "comments": 7, "reactions": {"like": 5, "love": 2, "wow": 1, "haha": 5}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18792, "page_engaged_users": 5504, "page_views": 7019, "page_consumption": 31187}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-19T05:59:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1634133729989001", "message": "#10762 I gotta say that I'm addicted to the adrenaline rush that you get when you try to cram 500 slides in 3 hours before the exam.", "comments": 13, "reactions": {"like": 112, "love": 5, "haha": 19, "sorry": 10}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18792, "page_engaged_users": 5504, "page_views": 7019, "page_consumption": 31187}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-19T05:59:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1634133796655661", "message": "#10763 How do I tell a company I want to machine learn in someone else's cloud :(", "comments": 5, "reactions": {"like": 17, "love": 1, "wow": 3, "haha": 4, "sorry": 2}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18792, "page_engaged_users": 5504, "page_views": 7019, "page_consumption": 31187}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-19T05:59:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1634135299988844", "message": "#10771 So I thought I was retarded, turns out just dyslexic.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 6, "love": 3, "sorry": 4}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 18792, "page_engaged_users": 5504, "page_views": 7019, "page_consumption": 31187}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-19T05:59:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1634136026655438", "message": "#10776 One of the first guys I met when I came here was Elian Malkin during orientation and REX activities.
