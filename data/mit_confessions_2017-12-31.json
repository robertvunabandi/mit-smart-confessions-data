After working for a year at a cushy Course 6-related job and coming home for the holidays, I decided to catch up with some of my old high school friends that I used to be really close to. We still crack the same old jokes at each other and have a good time overall, but I find myself wanting to avoid talking about my new comfortable lifestyle, as many of them have struggled to find a job that they enjoy or relates to their major or doesn't exhaust them. I understand that this is the reality for most people and I appreciate the opportunities I've been given in this lifetime so far, but it hurts to see my old friends struggling to get by with jobs that they hate and/or wear them out mainly because of the different opportunities that were presented to us at the relatively young age of 17-18.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 51, "love": 4, "wow": 1, "sorry": 18}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19039, "page_engaged_users": 5318, "page_views": 5307, "page_consumption": 24076}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-31T08:15:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1645419538860420", "message": "#11191 Please come back from break early, it's cold here and I want to cuddle.", "comments": 8, "reactions": {"like": 22, "love": 6, "wow": 2, "sorry": 2}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19039, "page_engaged_users": 5318, "page_views": 5307, "page_consumption": 24076}}, {"created_time": "2017-12-31T08:15:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1645418185527222", "message": "#11181 \"Son, how did you get into MIT?
