I think everyone's experience here differs, and I know of quite a few people who feel as though they've gotten opportunities here that they couldn't get anywhere else. I certainly feel like I've had some of those opportunities, but I feel as though there's not really that much positive reinforcement at this school. Throughout my time here, I've simply encountered feedback on how inadequate I was, no matter how hard I try sometimes. I guess it's good to know what my shortcomings are so that I can do better next time, but at the same time, I've never felt so dispassionate about my work as I do now. I've always known that there are lots of things I can improve, but I've rarely had an environment in which essentially everything that I tried to do turned out to be a failure.
