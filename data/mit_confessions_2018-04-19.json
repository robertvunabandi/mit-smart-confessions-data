I apologize if this somehow comes off as offensive (but I can also see the comments section becoming a frenzy either way).\n\nAt the moment, I imagine that most, if not a lot, of people find that a person's sexuality very important when it comes to finding a suitable partner to have sexual/emotio nal relations with. I think that, for the most part, it would make sense for a person currently undergoing a sexual transition to eventually disclose to the other party (who may or may not be accepting of a gender transition) that they are in fact transgender. \n\nIf in the near future we were able to undergo gender reassignment surgery so perfect that one wouldn't be able to tell a female born at birth vs. male born at birth -> transitioned into a female, then would it/should it be something to be disclosed to others?", "comments": 1, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 24151, "page_engaged_users": 975, "page_views": 1042, "page_consumption": 2555}}, {"created_time": "2018-04-19T22:39:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1760249147377458", "message": "#13331 I\u2019m a white male, and my girlfriend is half-Asian, half-white.
