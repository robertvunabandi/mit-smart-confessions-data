Where is that place for you?\" Robert, Queen of Katwe.\n\nCome and enjoy PLANTAINS, CHICKEN, AND DRINKS (And a WARM company of cause) whilst watching the award winning movie.\n\nBased on the true story.\n\nA lovely inspiring story with an amazing cast. This is one of those uplifting intelligent movies that you really can\u2019t fault too much, and it\u2019s a welcome break from all the blockbusters movies. It is cliched but even that is handled well as it offers some powerful lessons about life, perseverance, and success against all odds",
