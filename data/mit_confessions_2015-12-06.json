So let's have one at MIT!  We will start a tradition, the Infinite Streak, that on the night before finals begin every term (Sunday, Dec 13, this term), we meet in Lobby 7 just before 10pm, and at exactly 10pm, strip naked, and run down the Infinite and back.  All are welcome and hopefully we'll get a good gender mix of runners along with some spectators to cheer them on. It will be a great way to relieve stress. Please spread the word and like and share this with your friends, dorms, frats, sororities, clubs, teams, etc.  Start a tradition of doing the run within your group, or start your own goal of doing 8 of 8 naked runs.\n(FAQ: Why down the Infinite and back and not a loop? If someone wants to stop, they don't have to finish a loop. Those enjoying it can even go out and back again.  What do I wear when I show up?  Clothes or a towel.  Where do I leave the clothes?  In Lobby 7, since that's where the run ends.  Why doesn't the run go outside?  Safety in the cold weather - even UC Berkeley stays inside.  What about cameras?  Spectators and runners alike will probably bring their cameras to document the run and we can't stop them.  Do I have to be totally naked?  It's encouraged, but we certainly can't require it.)\ntl;dr - Dec 13, 10pm, Lobby 7, strip and then naked run down and back the Infinite", "comments": 1, "reactions": {}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 0, "page_engaged_users": 0, "page_views": 0, "page_consumption": 0}}]
