If I tend to find taller men more physically attractive, does this make me racist against any race whose genetic composition makes members of that race, on average, shorter? For clarity, assume I don't have a \"height cutoff\" and can be attracted to shorter men for many other reasons, but height is generally a factor in my physical attraction.\n\nAlso, if I think brown eyes are very beautiful, more so than blue/green/etc eyes, am I being racist against any race whose genetic composition results in predominantly blue eyes?\n\nAt what point do I have the right to be attracted to one person over another without being racist? Why can't I be attracted to certain features more than others, if my attractions are based on those features and not on my knowledge of someone's race? And, since perhaps the genetic makeup of one race results in many people with many of the features I like, why can't I say that I'm more likely to be attracted to a member of that race? Remember, nowhere here have I said that this is a checklist. It's not that I'd *only* be attracted to people of that race. It's simply more likely because statistically there are more people with the features that attract me.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 14}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19343, "page_engaged_users": 6695, "page_views": 6828, "page_consumption": 28753}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-18T05:19:57+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1664013477001026", "message": "#11772 I melt whenever I hear my boyfriend talk about how excited he is to go to grad school.", "comments": 7, "reactions": {"like": 16, "love": 8, "wow": 3}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19343, "page_engaged_users": 6695, "page_views": 6828, "page_consumption": 28753}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-18T05:19:48+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1664013390334368", "message": "#11771 Does Cyril Creque-Sarbinowski think he's being funny by spamming all of us multiple times a day with \"update tetazoo glounge\" ?", "comments": 6, "reactions": {"like": 18, "love": 2, "haha": 3, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19343, "page_engaged_users": 6695, "page_views": 6828, "page_consumption": 28753}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-18T05:18:25+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1664012570334450", "message": "#11762 stop writing confessions about me goddamn", "comments": 7, "reactions": {"like": 8, "haha": 2, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19343, "page_engaged_users": 6695, "page_views": 6828, "page_consumption": 28753}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-18T05:18:18+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1664012520334455", "message": "#11761 \"Our college confessions page got hacked, so we are going to be utilizing this google form for awhile\" you're smart people hack them back", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 3, "haha": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19343, "page_engaged_users": 6695, "page_views": 6828, "page_consumption": 28753}}]
