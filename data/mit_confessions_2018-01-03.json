It's not supposed to be something you look for--following your path, it just happens.  It's kind of like how in a lot of stories, a protagonist finds they're magical and then finds a world that loves them.  By the finale, they grow in power, and personally.  They never hopped world trying to find a place, and that is true for many people here. There are many goofballs or small town students who are accepted into a FSILG or student group that fosters and loves them like this.  They never went out of their way to find them; it just happened. \n\nSo yeah. I need to keep looking for groups. But as I get older, I will never be in the role of the little one, the mentored freshman, that needs to be taken care of. I need to harden, because people will expect a junior to coddle, not be coddled. I will never have this magical transition so many people have here, and it eats away at me because I missed this fun development process they got through no effort of their own.", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 8, "wow": 1, "anger": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19082, "page_engaged_users": 6280, "page_views": 5758, "page_consumption": 28437}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-03T06:26:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1648610728541301", "message": "#11273 Any other students at MIT play Runescape?
