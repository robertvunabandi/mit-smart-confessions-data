You flirted with me before we made out and you suggested we go out to a restaurant the following day. If going out to a restaurant isn't a date under these circumstances, then I don't know what is... We then made out the following day when we couldn't go on the restaurant date and after I revealed some private stuff to you, you said it couldn't work out because it 'dawned upon you' we live far even though you knew where I went to college from the moment you walked in the door. You should have thought this out because I'm pissed you fucked with my emotions.", "comments": 1, "reactions": {"like": 4, "sorry": 17}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19103, "page_engaged_users": 5750, "page_views": 7517, "page_consumption": 31255}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-04T04:03:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1649574455111595", "message": "#11316 @Rishad Rahman, OP from #11210 here.\nI wasn't sure if I should reach out through Facebook messenger or not, but I just wanted to thank you for sharing your experience and words of encouragement. I've reached out to friends regarding my depression and doubt, but nobody has ever encouraged me so much as you have. Thank you so so much for helping me realize that I matter and reinforcing the fact that I need to do what's best for me. In addition, thank you for letting me know that I am not alone in battling against depression, and that I can do it. \nI am truly thankful for your words and I hope you can find your niche soon :)", "comments": 4, "reactions": {"like": 29, "love": 15}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19103, "page_engaged_users": 5750, "page_views": 7517, "page_consumption": 31255}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-04T04:02:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1649573935111647", "message": "#11314 Is it bad to have a crush while in a relationship?", "comments": 8, "reactions": {"like": 6, "wow": 3, "haha": 2}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19103, "page_engaged_users": 5750, "page_views": 7517, "page_consumption": 31255}}, {"created_time": "2018-01-04T04:02:00+0000", "story": null, "post_id": "462508190484900_1649573631778344", "message": "#11312 I think my boyfriend is going to cheat on me during IAP and I don't know what I'll do if he really does", "comments": 2, "reactions": {"like": 3, "sorry": 1}, "page_data": {"page_fans": 19103, "page_engaged_users": 5750, "page_views": 7517, "page_consumption": 31255}}]
