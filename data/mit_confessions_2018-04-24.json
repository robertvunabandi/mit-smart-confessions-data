Sure, the resources here are top-tier and everything, and the people here are the smartest in the world. But this is the problem. In my high school, I can satisfy myself everyday indulging on the mere thought that I am the smartest person in the school. I can treat people like lesser beings without feeling remorse and take pleasure in the process.
