You have probably heard some variant of \u201cMIT Frats are different\u201d in the last week. As wet Wednesday approaches, I can confirm they are different, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re safe. If you don\u2019t protect yourself, the unfortunate reality is that you are a target to be assaulted at or after these parties. I struggle to recount all the girls who have told me about the guys who forced themselves after no\u2019s, when they were blackout ,or when they were passed out. It is never your fault, but you need to protect yourselves at these parties. Don\u2019t not have fun, but don\u2019t deceive yourself into thinking that because you\u2019re at MIT, you can let your guard down.
